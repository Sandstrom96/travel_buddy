Tokyo (����, Tōkyō) is Japan's capital and the world's most populous metropolis. It is also one of Japan's 47 [prefectures](https://www.japan-guide.com/list/e1002.html), consisting of 23 central city wards and multiple cities, towns and villages west of the city center. The [Izu](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e8252.html) and [Ogasawara Islands](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e8200.html) are also part of Tokyo.

Prior to 1868, Tokyo was known as Edo. Previously a small [castle town](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2296.html), Edo became Japan's political center in 1603 when [Tokugawa Ieyasu](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2128.html) established his feudal government there. A few decades later, Edo had grown into one of the world's largest cities. With the [Meiji Restoration](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2130.html) of 1868, the [emperor](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2135.html) and capital moved from [Kyoto](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2158.html) to Edo, which was renamed Tokyo ("Eastern Capital"). Large parts of Tokyo were destroyed in the [Great Kanto Earthquake](https://www.japan-guide.com/a/earthquake/) of 1923 and the air raids of 1945.

Today, Tokyo offers a seemingly unlimited choice of [shopping](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3053.html), entertainment, culture and [dining](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3075.html) to its visitors. The city's history can be appreciated in districts such as [Asakusa](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3004.html) and in many excellent [museums](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3054.html), historic temples and [gardens](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3034.html). Contrary to common perception, Tokyo also offers a number of attractive [green spaces](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3034.html) in the city center and within relatively short train rides at its outskirts.

In addition to sushi, he has honed his skills in Japanese cuisine at the esteemed Akasaka Kikunoi, giving him a strong foundation in traditional Japanese culinary techniques.

He uses a premium rice variety from Akita, enhanced with two types of red vinegar and plum vinegar to create a refreshing flavor.

    Yakiniku



    The restaurant is proud of its "Tare Yakiniku" (grilled meat with sauce), which is made from Japanese black beef that has inherited the "excellent sauce" from the main restaurant, and is so tender that it melts in your mouth.The beef tongue is also superb. The thickly cut beef tongue is very difficult to grill, so the waiter grills it and serves it to you. Enjoy a blissful moment with wine that pairs well with the meat.
