Colorful leaves (紅葉, kōyō) are to the Japanese autumn what [cherry blossoms](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2011.html) are to spring. The viewing of autumn leaves has been a popular activity in Japan for centuries and today draws large numbers of travelers to famous koyo spots both in the mountains and in the cities.

Each year, starting in mid September, the "koyo front" slowly moves southwards from the northern island of [Hokkaido](https://www.japan-guide.com/list/e1101.html) until it reaches the lower elevations of central and southern Japan around late November. Some trees around [Tokyo](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2164.html) and [Kyoto](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2158.html) remain colorful into December.
