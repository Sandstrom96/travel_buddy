These business hours will also vary throughout the country.\nBelow is a rough guide to some of the more general businesses and services. However, make sure to check the individual websites for the opening hours of the places or facilities that you are planning to visit.\n|  | Weekdays | Sat. | Sun. & National Holidays |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Banks (with tellers) | 09:00-15:00 | closed | closed |\n| Post Offices | 09:00-17:00 | closed | closed |\n| Dept.

The last week of December into the first week of January, Golden Week—a few days at the end of April into May—and the Obon holiday in mid-August are three of the main holiday periods. Many businesses are closed during the few days surrounding New Years. Golden Week sees a lot of both domestic and international travel, while during Obon many Japanese head to their family homes in more rural parts of the country.\nTraffic and resorts tend to be extremely busy during these times, so make sure to book any tickets or hotels in advance. Generally, the shinkansen, express trains, night-buses, and other forms of long-distance transportation can often be booked just one month in advance of the date you wish to travel, meaning a mad scramble as people try to get hold of tickets for the first day of the holidays. Be sure to research thoroughly and make the necessary arrangements.\nThe dates on this calendar are bank holidays, so be aware of closures and crowded transportation. For more culturally and spiritually significant days, look up regional festivals and events.\n### List of National Holidays\n| Date | Name of the Day |\n| --- | --- |\n| January 1st | New Year's Holiday |\n| The 2nd Monday of January | Coming-of-Age Day |\n| February 11th | National Foundation Day |\n| February 23rd | The Emperor's Birthday |\n| March 20th or March 21st\\* | Vernal Equinox Day |\n| April 29th | Showa Day |\n| May 3rd | Constitution Memorial Day |\n| May 4th | Greenery Day |\n| May 5th | Children's Day |\n| The 3rd Monday of July | Marine Day |\n| The 3rd Monday of September | Respect for the Aged Day |\n| September 22nd or September 23rd\\* | Autumnal Equinox Day |\n| The 2nd Monday of October | Health and Sports Day |\n| November 3rd | Culture Day |\n| November 23rd | Labor Thanksgiving Day |"}
{"filename": "www.japan.travel_en_plan_currency.md", "country": "japan", "region": "General", "url": "", "title": "Unknown", "category": "general", "text": "# Currency\n- Currency\n## Currency and currency exchange\nIf you haven't prepared cash in advance, it's easy to exchange any currency into Japanese yen once you arrive in the country. All major airports have exchange points in their respective arrivals halls. Even though it is possible to buy train tickets, take taxis, and pay for most other services on offer at the airport with international credit cards, carrying some cash is recommended. You will need some during your stay.\nJapan, however, is very much a cash-based society, so keep cash on you. It's worth noting that ATMs often charge for withdrawals and this charge can vary depending on the time you're making a withdrawal. Not all ATMs are 24 hours and, in central areas, may run out of cash at times. Be prepared by having enough cash on hand.\nYen (JPY) comes in bills of 1,000 yen, 2,000 yen, 5,000 yen and 10,000 yen, and coins of 1 yen, 5 yen, 10 yen, 50 yen, and 500 yen. Carrying a purse for your Japanese coins throughout your stay in Japan is a good idea since the value of them (and weight in your wallet) soon adds up.\nWhile the 10,000 yen note is equivalent to around 100 dollars, the note is generally accepted even if buying something small. Be aware that not many 2,000 yen notes are in circulation. They are accepted but can be easily confused with the 1,000 yen note, so make sure you get the correct change after using them.\nWhen entering or leaving Japan, a customs declaration is required if you are carrying more than one million yen in cash, checks, traveler's checks, securities, etc. Refer to the official website of Japan customs for a comprehensive understanding of any necessary procedures.\n### ATM Information\n#### Japan Post Bank ATMs\nYou can dispense cash from one of the many Japan Post Bank ATMs located nationwide. Most of them are in the Post Offices, but you can also find some at train stations and supermarkets. Service hours differ by ATM. The service is available in English.\nYucho (Japan Post Bank)\n#### Seven Bank ATMs\nWithdraw cash from the nationwide network of ATMs located mainly in the Seven Eleven convenience stores. Find screens, receipts and voice guidance in 12 languages—English, Korean, Chinese simplified, Chinese traditional, Portuguese, Thai, Malay, Indonesian, Vietnamese, French, German, and Japanese) when using cards issued overseas.\nSeven Bank\n#### Mizuho Bank\nHead to one of the Mizuho Bank branches to withdraw cash using an international card. Withdrawals and balance inquiries are possible. However, you cannot make deposits or transfers.\nMizuho Bank\n#### Mitsubishi UFJ Bank\nUse your Visa, MasterCard, Maestro or Cirrus card to withdraw cash from one of the branches of Mitsubishi UFJ Bank.\nMitsubishi UFJ Bank\n#### Mitsui Sumitomo Bank\nYou can use your Visa, MasterCard, Maestro or Cirrus card at branches of SMBC Banks.\nMitsui Sumitomo Bank\n#### Others\nJapan's four major airports— Narita Airport Haneda Airport Chubu Centrair International Airport and\nKansai International Airport— have ATMs. ATM service fees may be charged when withdrawing money, depending on the hour or day.\nForeign currency can usually be exchanged at exchange counters, banks, and some hotels, and World Currency Shops are dotted around the country. Exchange rates fluctuate daily in accordance with financial market trends. Currency that can be exchanged depends on the exchange counter.\nResearch the currency exchange options at the airport that you are flying into— Narita Airport (Chiba, Tokyo), Haneda Airport (Tokyo), New Chitose Airport (Hokkaido), Chubu Centrair International Airport (Aichi), Kansai International Airport (Osaka), Fukuoka Airport, Naha Airport (Okinawa).\n### Banks\nYou can also exchange foreign currency at major banks. Branches generally have convenient locations—often in front of train stations—however, be aware that many close at 3 p.m. Research the major banks in Japan— The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Mizuho Bank, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation—and the Japan Post Bank."}
{"filename": "www.japan.travel_en_plan_custom-manners.md", "country": "japan", "region": "General", "url": "", "title": "Unknown", "category": "general", "text": "# Custom & Manners\n- Custom & Manners\n## If unsure, politeness and common sense go a long way\nFollowing a general travelers code of respect for the people you meet and places you visit will stand you in good stead. Always ask if you are unsure of any particular cultural curiosities—the locals will be more than happy to tell you.\nFor first-time visitors, Japan can be both extremely familiar and outrageously alien. Learning a little about the custom of a particular region or place will untangle a few of the potential knots of confusion, as well as giving you a more fulfilling experience.\n### General greetings and etiquette\nThe Japanese custom of bowing may seem unfamiliar if you are not used to it. The act is deeply embedded in Japanese culture and can be full of tricky nuance—especially in the business world. As a guest in the country, you will more likely be bowed at, rather than expected to bow. However, to show your respect, it's a nice extra gesture to go with your “arigato” or thank you.\nEtiquette in public places is a serious business in Japan—a public-wide respect for these rules is probably the main reason why a megalopolis like Tokyo can function so smoothly. Generally speaking, common sense is the order of the day. Show respect for the places you are in and the people who are there, especially on public transport. If you carry a phone, keep it on silent mode and avoid speaking on it. If in doubt, just follow the locals.\n### Eating out\nNowadays, chopsticks can be found on dining tables all around the globe, so most visitors will not be surprised or fazed to see the neat pair of wooden sticks lined up in many of Japan's restaurants. If you are uncomfortable using them and would prefer a different kind of utensil, just ask the staff. Be aware however, an alternative may not be available—especially at more traditional spots.\nIf you have come to Japan for the sushi, remember that you can eat it with your hands. Pick up a piece, dip it into the bowl of soy-sauce, and enjoy.\nWhen eating the variety of noodle dishes that Japan has to offer, local culture dictates that you slurp rather than chew—some will tell you that this even enhances the flavor. Whether you choose to slurp or not is up to you, just don't mind if the table next to you is making a little more noise than you might be used to.\n### Staying overnight\nMost western hotels in Japan follow the same practices that you would expect throughout the world (with the exception of tipping, there is no need). However, the more traditional ryokan hotels still follow a time-honored code of conduct. From taking off your shoes at the entrance, to sleeping on futons on the floor, when you enter a ryokan, you are entering Japan from a different age.\nThe Yukata gowns that you will usually find in your rooms can sometimes be worn outside, sometimes not. Same with the slippers. A list of dos and don'ts will adorn the walls of the communal bathrooms, and dinner may be served in your room or in a communal dining room. If you are feeling confused, don't be. If in doubt, simply ask. This is the best way to avoid any awkward misunderstandings, and the staff will be more than happy to help you."}
{"filename": "www.japan.travel_en_plan_emergencies.md", "country": "japan", "region": "General", "url": "", "title": "Unknown", "category": "general", "text": "# Staying Safe in Japan\n- Staying Safe in Japan\n## What to do in an emergency\nWhile Japan sits at the top of many general safety rankings, travelers to the country still need to be aware of potential dangers and how best to react to them. Japan is prone to natural disasters such as typhoons, earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanic eruptions. While most are small in scale, it's important to be prepared.\n### Is Japan safe?\nIn short, Japan is very safe and the crime rate is quite low. Like any other destination, though, travelers should be aware of their surroundings and know what to do in case something does happen.\nThere is always a possibility, however unlikely, that you might fall victim to a form of petty crime during your stay in Japan. If you need help, head to a local koban—the small police boxes dotted throughout Japanese neighborhoods. If you don't know where one is, just ask. If you should find yourself without your credit cards, airline tickets or passports due to theft, contact the issuers to arrange for replacements. Keep a list of relevant numbers.\nIf you need to have your passport reissued or receive an insurance payment due to theft, loss, traffic or other incident, a police report will be required. A local police station can create this for you. Visit your nearest koban, and if you are staying at a hotel, ask the front desk to give you a hand.\nYour embassy is also a useful point of contact in case of any emergencies, so make a note of the location and relevant contact details before arriving in Japan. You will need to get in touch with your embassy if you need a replacement passport. Just in case, make a couple of copies of your passport and keep one with you and leave one at home. The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department website tells you everything you need to know about staying safe during your time in Japan, from reporting a crime or accident to traffic safety and natural disasters.\n### Earthquakes in Japan\nAlthough they should not deter you from visiting Japan, natural disasters such as earthquakes do occur. Compared to other countries, earthquakes are common in Japan, so it's best to be prepared.\nEarthquakes can occur at any time and strike with little or no warning. Japan's location on shifting tectonic plates means that the country is almost always shaking—it's just that many of the quakes go unnoticed. If you are inside during a larger earthquake, remember to stay calm and follow any instructions staff might give. When you check into a hotel, double-check where the evacuation routes are so you know where to go in an emergency. Fire is the most dangerous secondary disaster, so extinguish any naked flames as quickly as possible during an earthquake. Make sure to keep your phone and devices fully charged. These can be indispensable in the event of any emergency. If you are by the coast when a large earthquake strikes, head for higher ground in case of a tsunami.\nIf you encounter a significant natural disaster like a typhoon, earthquake, tsunami, or volcanic eruption while in Japan, you can use the following websites and apps for information:\n・ Japan Safe Travel Information (Web)\n・ Safety Tips (APP Download)\n・ NHK WORLD-JAPAN (Web)\n・ NHK WORLD-JAPAN (APP Download)\n### Useful phone numbers\nIn addition to the emergency number of 110, the Metropolitan Police in Tokyo has an English helpline available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.—Dial 03-3501-0110 for this service. For mental health support, Tokyo English Life Line (TELL) has a hotline open on 03-5774-0992 Monday through Thursday 9 a.m. to 11 p.m. and Friday through Sunday 9 a.m. to 2 a.m.\nThe JNTO Tourist Information Center in Tokyo is a phone call away at 03-3201-3331, every day 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tourist Information Centers (TIC) also has two locations at Narita International Airport, and one at Kansai International Airport in Osaka.\nJapan Tourism Agency's \" Guide for when you are feeling ill\" provides medical institutions information, search methods, and guidelines. The website is available in English, Chinese, and Korean.\nThe AMDA International Medical Information Center provides Medical Questionnaire in Multilanguage and other information.\n### Travel insurance\nSign up for travel insurance with adequate coverage before your departure so that you can enjoy your stay in Japan without any worries."}

While you should be mindful of the following, thorough research through the proper channels is strongly recommended.\nBe sure to carry your passport with you at all times as a form of identification. The chances are you won't need to show it, but there is always a chance that you may be required to do so.\n### Smoking\nSmoking is not allowed in most restaurants and bars, except in designated areas. This rule is strictly enforced—especially in the country's main cities—and can result in a fine, so don't walk and smoke, find a smoking area.\n### Drinking\nDrinking outside on the other hand doesn't violate any laws—in fact, it's part of the culture, especially during the hanami season in spring when picnics under the cherry blossoms are common. However, while this might be the case, loud and boisterous behavior is not part of Japanese culture, so try to keep any outdoor partying under control. Be sure to take any litter home with you.\n### Tattoos\nThe issue of tattoos is a thorny one in Japan. Having a historical association with crime in Japan, many public swimming pools, public baths, hot spring resorts, and gyms prohibit entry to anyone with tattoos—even small ones. The rules are loosening slightly, and some establishments will simply ask you to cover any tattoos up. Research in advance to avoid any disappointment.\n### Drugs\nThere is zero tolerance towards any kind of drug-related crime. Simply put, just don't do it.\nBe aware that cannabis is treated in the same way as other drugs. Possession of a small amount can lead to a prison sentence, so please don't bring cannabis into the country; even if it is prescribed in your country of origin.\nMore information: https://www.npa.go.jp/english/bureau/criminal\\_affairs/image/warning\\_illegal\\_drugs\\_in\\_japan.pdf"}
{"filename": "www.japan.travel_en_plan_tipping-in-japan.md", "country": "japan", "region": "General", "url": "", "title": "Unknown", "category": "general", "text": "# Tipping\n- Tipping\n## Tipping culture in Japan is a little different\nTipping practices in Japan differ significantly from those in many other countries. In Japan, it's not common to tip for services such as those provided in bars, cafes, restaurants, taxis, and hotels. However, there is a custom in Japan of giving a gratuity, called \"\"kokorozuke\"\", (coming from the heart), in some situations.\nThere are certain situations where tipping might be considered appropriate. For instance, if you've engaged a private guide or interpreter accustomed to overseas practices, they may accept a tip as a gesture of gratitude. It's worth noting that tipping is not expected and should be done discreetly, even in these cases. If you do decide to offer a gratuity, it is customary to put it in an envelope. You can purchase small cash envelopes at convenience stores, stationery stores, or 100 yen stores."}

For Safe and Convenient Accessibility makes traveling by train much easier because it highlights the degree of accessibility of stations across Japan.\nAt major train stations, airports, and hotels, as well as in most newer shopping centers and theaters in the city, the disabled traveler or wheelchair user should have little trouble getting from place to place.\nAbout 95 percent of Japan's train stations are entirely accessible, and work continues to improve accessibility at other public facilities, including the installation of elevators, wheelchair ramps, and other accommodations.\nWalking the streets is very easy as the sidewalks are smooth, and for anybody with a visual impairment, raised yellow tiles indicate safe walking paths. However, catching a taxi can be a challenge as most standard cabs are unable to support customers in electric wheelchairs.

The weather varies greatly from region to region, so check the weather forecast for the areas you'll be traveling to.\n### Geography\nLocated in East Asia, Japan is a curved-shaped archipelago with the Sea of Japan along the west coast and the Pacific Ocean along the east coast. Its closest neighbors are South Korea, Russia, and Taiwan near the southernmost Okinawan islands known as Yonaguni. Japan's size is often compared to that of Germany and it is slightly smaller than the state of California and somewhat larger than the United Kingdom.\nJapan's land is made up of dense forest and mountainous terrain covering 70 percent of the country, held in place by the Japan Alps—the series of mountain ranges spanning the central area of the main island of Honshu. Japan has many geologically active volcanoes and eruptions are common.\nAlong the coastlines and flat areas, you will find many of the major cities—in some cases built on reclaimed land. There are many beautiful beaches with some great surfing spots on the country's peninsulas—the Boso Peninsula, Izu Peninsula, and Kii Peninsula among others—as well as many places to snorkel and dive. Heading further south, you will reach the subtropics of Okinawa and its outlying islands.\nNational parks and protected ecological zones house a range of distinctive wildlife and geographical points of interest from Akan-Mashu National Park in the wilds of Hokkaido, to the UNESCO World Heritage accredited Ogasawara Islands located 1,000 kilometers south of Tokyo in the Pacific Ocean.\nMany islands are uninhabited and nature is beginning to take some of them back in dramatic fashion—visit Tomogashima Island and its abandoned and now overgrown red-brick military buildings.\n### Weather through the seasons\nEvery season in Japan has its charms, brought by the seasonal changes in temperature and weather. Read below to learn what distinguishes each season from the rest in Japan.\n### Spring\nA welcome break from the winter cold, spring is celebrated throughout the country with the arrival of the cherry blossoms. Starting in the south and gradually moving north, the blossoms bloom between March and May depending on your location. Cool and breezy with generally sunny skies, spring is a comfortable time to get out and explore the cities and countryside. Leading into summer, the rainy season begins in May to June.\n### Summer\nSummer throughout Japan is stiflingly hot and intensely humid—make sure to keep hydrated. The beaches are packed, firework displays explode above the nation's rivers, and street festivals are held around every corner. The mountains offer some respite from the major city cauldrons. Be aware that August and September may bring typhoons that can thwart your travel plans.\n### Autumn\nAs the weather cools, the autumn colors light-up the countryside. Starting in the northern island of Hokkaido and traveling south, the dazzling autumn leaves blanket the country between late September and early December. Similar to spring, the fall season is perfect for outdoor exploration and a great time to taste what's in Japan's larder.\n### Winter\nThe ski season begins and the northern areas are covered with Japan's peerless powder snow. The weather varies from region to region, but winter brings many sunny days and beautiful blue skies. Warm up with some hot sake and a bowl of bubbling hot-pot.\n### Average temperatures and precipitation\n### Tokyo\n### Kyoto\n### Sapporo\n### Sendai\n### Kanazawa\n### Fukuoka\n### Naha\n### Earthquakes and Volcanos\nLocated on the Pacific Ring of Fire, Japan has over 100 active volcanos. Most of them are not a threat to human activity, but it is best to check the latest news and warnings about volcanic activity in the areas where you may be traveling.\nIn addition, Japan is located on the fault lines of four tectonic plates, making earthquakes a common occurrence. There have been several devastating earthquakes in the last 100 years, including the Great East Japan Earthquake on March 11, 2011. Small earthquakes happen on a daily basis somewhere in Japan, and many of them are barely noticeable. However, before your trip, familiarize yourself with earthquake preparedness and make sure to locate the designated evacuation area for the buildings where you stay.\n### Heat Illness Prevention Information\nAbout WBGT (Wet Bulb Globe Temperature) Information (PDF)"}
