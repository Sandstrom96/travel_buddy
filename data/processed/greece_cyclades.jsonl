The charming white and blue coloured\nCycladic architecture, the traditional lifestyle, island songs, warm hospitality, the land\nwith no vegetation dotted by deserted country chapels, an amazing coastline and\nexcellent sandy beaches all form a harmonious blend, making a trip to Cyclades truly\nunique.\nThe islands have a total land area of 2,528 sq km. Out of the 2,200 islands, islets and\nsmaller rocks, only 25 are populated today. The capital, Ermoupoli, is located on Syros\nisland. The name “Cyclades” means “the islands that form a circle” around the sacred\nisland of Delos. Greek mythology refers to Cyclades as a creation of Poseidon (or\nNeptune), who turned Cyclades nymphs into islands, when they incurred his wrath.\nCyclades have been inhabited since the prehistoric times; however Cycladic culture\nflourished between 3200 B.C. and 1100 B.C. (Early Cycladic, Middle Cycladic and Late\nCycladic Period) when the islands, due to their geographic position, became a trade and\ncultural centre. In the 16th century B.C, the eruption of the volcano of Thira (Santorini)\nbrought the region’s development to a halt. A few centuries later Dorians settled in the\nCyclades. During the Byzantine period, the Cyclades islands belonged to the Aegean\nTheme (Administrative Division) and later passed to Venetian and Frankish rulers. For\nmany centuries these islands suffered pirate raids, which was why they were granted\npermission to build ships and fight back the pirates during the Turkish occupation.\nWith the Treaty of London in 1830, the islands were freed and became part of the\nGreek state.\nToday, millions of Greek and foreign travellers visit the Cyclades islands, looking for\nbright sunlight and clear blue waters to create their own version of a “magic holiday”.**\n**The website for all the islands is: http://www.cyclades-tour.gr**\n2. The Cyclades islands boast some amazing sandy beaches washed by crystal-clear waters.\nThis is Agios Georgios beach on Kimolos Island.\nKea (Tzia)\nK\n```\nea or Tzia is a beautiful Cyclades island and one of the most popular destinations because\nof its proximity to the eastern coast of Attica. It has an area of 130.5 sq. km., a coastline of\n81.5 km and a population of 2,420. The island is endowed with ever-changing scenery: steep\nmountains, small fields, olive groves, vineyards, ravines, picturesque coves and secluded beaches. It\nwas inhabited for the first time in the Late Neolithic era (3300 - 3200 BC) and experienced a period of\ncultural development during the Bronze Age. During the Archaic period (7th-6th c. B.C.) four city-states\nwere founded (Ioulida, Karthaia, Korissia, Poiiessa) which communicated via an intricate network of\npathways. During the byzantine period, the largest residential growth took place in the area around\nIoulida. Kea was occupied by the Ottoman Turks from 1566 until 1821. It experienced great prosperity\nin the following period as a result of the opening of mines and factories and the creation of a busy\ntrading port on the island. Nowadays, there are growing residential neighbourhoods and rising numbers\nof tourists on the island.\n```\n3.

Merichas - the port\nof the island, Chora - the capital, Loutra and Dryopida are all located in the northern part.\nThe southern part of Kythnos is almost uninhabited, the only exception being the area of Panagia\nKanala and the small bay of Agios Dimitrios. The island has 65 lovely beaches (dirt roads leading\nto most of them) and typical Cyclades landscapes with bare and dry hills, surrounded by dry stone\nwalls stretching for many kilometres. The island is dotted with 350 picturesque snow-white country\nchapels and in the villages there are narrow streets paved with cobblestones, snow-white houses,\nsquares, churches and windmills. Dryopes or Dryopians, came from Evvoia (or Euboea) island and\nsettled on Kythnos during the 10th c. BC. The island flourished in classical times and contributed a\ntrireme (ancient greek galley) in the naval battle of Salamina. The island shared the historical fate\nof the rest of the Cyclades islands: in 1204 it came under Venetian rule, to be occupied later by the\nTurks. In 1830 it joined the newly formed Greek state. The island’s area is 99 sq. km, its coastline is\n111 km, and there are 1,600 inhabitants.\n```\nKythnos\n12.

It is situated between Kythnos\nand Sifnos, and its traditional island features have remained unaltered thanks to a moderate\ntourism growth. According to mythology, Perseus arrived on the coast of Serifos with his\nmother, Danae, locked up in a chest. To punish Polydefkis, king of Serifos, he killed Medusa the\nGorgon and showed him the severed head; that resulted in Polydefkis turning into stone.\nIn the land of Serifos there are valuable mineral resources which brought great prosperity to the island\nespecially after the 6th c. BC. During the Medic Wars the islanders battled against the Persians and\njoined the Delian League. Later, the island was conquered by the Macedonians, then by the Ptolemies\nand finally by the Romans. After the conquest of Constantinople by the Crusaders in 1204, Serifos\nwas ceded to Venetian nobles. In 1537, it was captured by the Turkish admiral Barbarossa, and from\n1770 until 1774 it was occupied by the Russians. After 1821 it was liberated along with the rest of the\nCyclades.

There are sandy\nbeaches, rocky coasts, and mountain ranges alternating with fertile plains, lush vegetation and\nmany streams. Andros has always been seen as a gateway to the Aegean Sea.\nThe island area is 400 sq. km, the coastline is 177 km and the population amounts to 10,000.\nIn antiquity it was a remarkably well organised society with high cultural standards. It has been\ninhabited since prehistoric times. In the 7th century BC, its residents founded extensive colonies in\nMacedonia. The Venetians occupied Andros until 1566 when the Turks conquered it. In 1790, the\nfleet led by Lampros Katsonis clashed with Turkish forces and suffered great destruction near the\nisland’s north-west shores, at Kafireas strait. Andros took part in the 1821 Greek Independence War.\nOne of the prominent personalities of the time was the scholar Theophilos Kairis.\n```\n56.

It is the\nhomeland of Ferekydis, an ancient Greek philosopher, teacher of Pythagoras. In the Neolithic Age,\nSyros was one of the most important islands of the Cycladic civilisation. In the 13th century the\nVenetians took the island over. The mediaeval town, built on a hill overlooking the port, its founding and\neveryday life structure have had a leading impact on the island’s history to this very day. During the Turkish\noccupation, many persecuted people from nearby islands took refuge here. In the late 19th century,\nthe island experienced an unprecedented growth: the construction of boatyards, trading stations and\nfactories, made Syros one of the most frequently visited islands of the Aegean, and Ermoupoli became\nthe hub of island life.

Today the island is uninhabited, but there are small boats running an\nitinerary daily from the neighbouring port of Mykonos (the distance is 6 nautical miles).\nDelos was first inhabited in 2500 BC. The first residents were the Carians, followed by the Mycenaeans.\nIn 1100 BC, the Ionians populated the island. Around 700 BC, Delos had already been established as the\nreligious centre of the Ionians who held their Great Assembly there along with other Panhellenic events.\nParos, Naxos, Samos, Athens and many other Ionian cities offered numerous oblations to the sacred island.\nWhen the Persian invaders came, they respected the island’s sacred character.

During the 3rd century BC\nthe Athenian influence weakened, and Delos\ncame under the influence of the Macedonians.\nFrom the middle of the 3rd century BC, Apollo’s\nsacred island turned into a significant trading\ncentre, with wealthy traders and bankers\nsettling in. During the Roman period, the island\nwas declared a free trading port and wealthy\nRoman merchants and ship owners moved in. At\nthat time, 20,000 Romans, Egyptians, Syrians,\nPhoenicians and Jews lived in Delos.\nIn 88 BC the island was destroyed by Mithridates,\nthe King of Pontus, and completely lost its\nsacred character. During the early centuries\nof Christianity, the population of the island\ndiminished, and Delos gradually fell\ninto an irreversible decline. Any\nremnants of the old days of glory\ndied away after the iconoclast\nByzantine Emperor Leo the\nIsaurian plundered the island\n```\nin 727 AD, to be followed by the\nSlavs in 769 AD, and finally by the\nSaracens in 821 AD.\n```\n```\nMust see:\nThe archaeological site of Delos , included\nin the UNESCO List of World Heritage sites,\nthe most important monuments being:\n```\n- **Agora ton Ermaiston / Kompetaliaston**\n(Market place of the Hermaists or\nCompetialists), one of the main market places\nof the Hellenistic city of Delos.\n- **Naos ton Delion** (Temple of the Delians), the\nlargest of the three temples dedicated to Apollo.\n- **Andiro ton Leonton** (Terrace of the Lions)\ndedicated to Apollo by the people of the island\nof Naxos (7th century BC), with 9 out\nof the original 16 marble guardian lions being\npreserved, in the renowned “Lions Way”.\n- **Idryma ton Virytion Poseidoniaston**\n(Foundation of Beirut Poseidoniasts)\n(2nd century BC).\n- The **Theatre** (3rd century BC).\n113.

It is\nlocated at the easternmost edge of the Cyclades and boasts a singular character. The mountainous\nlandscape with impressive steep mountainsides and cultivation terraces with moderate yields, the\nsteep rocks by the coast in the southern part and the scenic bays with beautiful seashores in the northern\npart of the island, make up Amorgos’ topography.\nThe island has been inhabited since Prehistoric times and prospered during the Cycladic Period.\nAt that time, Amorgos developed a thriving trade, navigation and the arts. Three important ancient\ncities existed on the island, Minoa, Arkesini and Aigiali. During the Roman times, Amorgos used to be\na place of exile. Panagia Hozoviotissa Monastery, its landmark, was built during the Byzantine Period.\nDuring the Frankish rule, the island suffered numerous invasions, to be occupied in the 16th century\nby the Turks. Amorgos participated in the Greek Revolution against the Ottoman Empire in 1821. The\ntraditional Cycladic architectural style is evident in all of the island’s villages where local customs practice\nand a well-known musical tradition have survived the test of time. A dense network of hiking trails enables\nhikers to visit the monuments and enjoy the island’s natural beauty. Its area is 121 sq. km, its coastline is\n112 km and has a population of 1,850.

Katergo beach, on the island’s south shores.\nS\n```\nantorini is one of the best known Greek islands the world over. It is in itself a unique geological\nphenomenon, as today’s island is what has remained of the initial island, Strongyli (meaning\nRound), which sunk to the bottom of the sea following an eruption of its volcano during the 16th\ncentury B.C. This has been one of the most powerful eruptions in the history of Earth: three quarters of\nthe island were submerged, shaping today’s Caldera. Furthermore, the major aftermath of that eruption\nwas the destruction of the Minoan Palaces in Crete. Santorini’s area is 73 sq. km, its coastal length is\n69.5 km and there are 13,670 residents.\nSantorini is the southernmost island in the Cyclades group. The island of Santorini is actually a group\nof islands comprised of Thira, Thirasia, Aspronisi, Palaia Kameni and Nea Kameni (Kameni meaning\nburned). The island’s architectural heritage is preserved remarkably well in Fira and Oia as well as in\nother inland villages. An important prehistoric civilisation thrived on the island, mainly during the Middle\nCycladic Period, and was destroyed by the volcanic eruption. In time, the island was repopulated and\nit flourished during the Hellenistic and Roman times. Later on the Venetians took the island over and\nremained there for centuries. Over the last decades, Santorini has known a massive tourism growth.\nStill, the island has remained as appealing as ever, with secrets and places of unspoiled natural beauty\nyet to be explored, not to mention the lovely sunset for which Santorini has been renowned across\nthe planet. Local wine is famous and the island’s vineyards have been producing it since antiquity. The\ngrape varieties grown here are Asyrtiko, Athiri, Aidani, Mandilaria (red) and Mavrotragano (red). The\nquality of Vinsanto wine is exceptional and it is produced by mixing two varieties: Asyrtiko and Aidani.\n```\nSantorini (Thira)\n205.

There is also another version connecting the name of the island\nwith the non-existence of snakes on it (An-ofis: “an” meaning “absence of” and “ofis” meaning snake)!\nThe ancient town of Anafi was founded by Dorians during the 8th century BC. During the Byzantine\ntimes, Anafi had suffered pirate raids. In 1537, after interim periods of Venetian rule, the island was\noccupied by the Turks, following the invasion of Hayreddin Barbarossa who razed the place to the\nground.
