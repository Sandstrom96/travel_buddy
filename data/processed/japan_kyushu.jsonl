The prefecture’s culinary specialties include sushi and other seafood dishes, yakitori or grilled skewers, motsunabe hot pot in the winter, and tonkotsu or pork broth ramen, best enjoyed at a local yatai or food stall. Located on the northern tip of Kyushu and boasting excellent transportation links, Fukuoka is an easy destination.\n## How to Get There\nFukuoka is well connected by both rail and air. The prefecture has multiple stops on both the JR Kyushu Shinkansen and the JR Sanyo Shinkansen, which links to Hiroshima, Osaka, Kyoto and Tokyo. Fukuoka Airport is extremely close to the city center. Fukuoka City’s Hakata Port offers ferries to South Korea and to many of Kyushu’s smaller islands.\nFukuoka City is the prefecture’s main transport center, and from here you can easily board a train, bus or ferry that will take you to the rest of the prefecture and to other places in Kyushu. Hakata Station in Fukuoka City is the prefecture's rail hub, a terminus of both the Sanyo and Kyushu shinkansen lines. It takes one hour by shinkansen from Hiroshima to Fukuoka City, approximately two hours by train from Nagasaki to Fukuoka, and two hours by plane or five hours by shinkansen from Tokyo. Fukuoka is also very accessible from Asia via international flights.\n### Don’t Miss\n- The annual plum blossom display at Dazaifu Tenmangu Shrine\n- A tunnel of wisterias at Kawachi Fuji-en garden in Kitakyushu\n- Itoshima Peninsula’s seaside culture: sandy beaches, music festivals and an active surf scene\n- Luxurious boat rides through the canals of Yanagawa, and a meal of fresh local eel\n## Explore Fukuoka by Area\n- \\\\\nFukuoka City\n- \\\\\nAround Fukuoka City\n- \\\\\nKitakyushu\n- \\\\\nKurume & Yanagawa\n## Trending Attractions in Fukuoka\n- Dazaifu Tenman-gu ShrineDazaifu Tenman-gu Shrine\\\\\nDazaifu Tenmangu Shrine\n- Hakata Gion Yamakasa Festival\\\\\nHakata\n- Nakasu & Tenjin Area\\\\\nNakasu\n- Yanagawa River rapids ride\\\\\nYanagawa Punting\n- Itoshima Hanto\\\\\nItoshima Peninsula\n## Local Specialties\n- Amaou Strawberries\nAmaou is a variety of strawberry famous in Japan for its rich, sweet flavor. The name combines the Japanese words for red, round, big and delicious. Amaou strawberries are also used to make liqueur, jam and sweets.\n- Yame Tea\nThe Yame region in Fukuoka has ideal conditions for cultivating green tea. Tea growers here have been producing superb green tea using techniques passed down for 600 years. You can also find products that boast health benefits and combine honey with matcha powdered tea.\n- Baked Curry\nA popular Fukuoka comfort food similar to a casserole or gratin. Rice, beefy Japanese curry, cheese and a raw egg are layered in a baking dish and baked. This will fill and warm you up for sure.\n- Hakata Bite-Sized Gyoza\nHitokuchi gyoza are not so different to regular dumplings, just a little smaller in size. Filled with minced pork and garlic, fried crispy on the outside and tender inside. Since they are smaller, though, you'll probably end up eating more of them.\n- Fukuoka Motsu Nabe\nChefs in Fukuoka have made an art form of cooking with beef and pork tripe. Motsu nabe is a hot pot dish of tripe in a delicious soup made from soy sauce and garlic.\n- Mizutaki\nMizutaki is a hot pot dish made by simmering chicken chunks with seasonal vegetables in a chicken stock broth, then serving with ponzu, a citrus-based sauce. It is said to have otiginated in Fukuoka around the middle of the late 19th century.\n- Yakitori\nYakitori—typically skewers of juicy chicken, often interspersed with vegetables and grilled over an open flame—is a hugely popular dish in Fukuoka. There's even a festival in Kurume dedicated to yakitori every October. Pairs well with beer.\n- Tonkotsu Ramen\nOne of the world's best-known varieties of ramen, tonkotsu ramen is distinguished by its cloudy pork bone broth, thick slices of pork, thin noodles and minimal toppings. In Fukuoka, the birthplace of tonkotsu, you'll find the dish everywhere—at specialty restaurants, late-night eateries, street vendors and even train stations.\n- Kurume Textiles\nCool in summer and warm in winter, Kurume kasuri is a cotton textile that gets more comfy with wear. Made from resist-dyed indigo thread, the spectacular patterns and pictorial designs hand-woven into this fabric elevate it to an art form.\n- Koishiwara Ware\nClassy and simple, Koishiwara yaki gets its charm from the eye-catching patterns that artisans achieve by skillfully stamping, planing and painting the finished clay form as it rotates on the potter’s wheel. This casual yet elegant pottery is perfect for everyday tableware and home decor. A good place to pick some up is in the village of Toho, where the pottery is crafted.\n- Hakata Textiles\nFound in Fukuoka's Hakata district, Hakata ori Chinese weaving techniques were imported in the early 13th century. This dyed brocade, easy to tie and cinch, is perfect for obi sashes, and samurai belted their kimono and secured their scabbards with them. Hakata ori items now include card cases, wallets and other souvenir goods.\n- Hakata Dolls\nThe history of Hakata ningyo includes folkloric tales, archaeological artifacts and accounts of presentations at expos including the 1900 Paris World Fair. Today, these hand-painted clay dolls range from traditional characters like kimono-clad beautiful women to hulking sumo wrestlers and more.\n## Seasonal Highlights\n- Spring\nDazaifu Tenmangu Shrine turns into Japan’s best spot plum blossoms, with an enormous display of 6,000 trees in flower. Cherry blossoms and tulips soon follow, bringing the entire prefecture to life.\n- Summer\nLocals leave the city for barbecues and beaches on Itoshima Peninsula or head to the mountains to enjoy the cooler air at altitude. Dine at a yatai or outdoor food stall.\n- Autumn\nThe weather is at its most enjoyable as Fukuoka takes on autumn hues, particularly the leaves on Mt. Hiko. The little island of Nokonoshima has a beautiful display of cosmos flowers.\n- Winter\nSettle down to a steaming bowl of motsunabe, a local stew that warms you to the core. Cruise through Yanagawa's canals under a heated kotatsu blanket or head out to Itoshima to sample winter oysters."}

From incredible natural gems to ancient sites, there's plenty to see.\n### Don't Miss\n- Home to Dazaifu Tenmangu Shrine and the historic government seat of Kyushu, the Dazaifu area is packed with history and culture\n- A sunny peninsula full of beaches and mountains, Itoshima is Fukuoka City's summer getaway\n## How to Get There\nThe area around Fukuoka is well-connected by public transport from the city, including JR lines which you can ride with a JR pass.\nHakata is your main hub for getting out of the city with Hakata Bus Center and train lines available. Renting a car and traveling at your own pace is also an option to dig deeper into Fukuoka and its surroundings.\n### The ancient capital Dazaifu\nThe city of Dazaifu is one of Fukuoka Prefecture's best-known spots. It was established as the island's capital during the 7th century and flourished throughout much of Japan's early history. Trade and political relations with the continent were all carried out from here.\nDazaifu is home to Dazaifu Tenmangu Shrine, a shrine dedicated to Michizane Sugawara. The shrine is situated in beautiful grounds, which contain some 6,000 plum trees.\nAlso in the area is Mt Homan, a great half-day hike, and the Kyushu National Museum which is dedicated to local and Japanese history.\n### Munakata & Okinoshima shrines\nWithin the bounds of Munakata City and Okinoshima are three Munakata Taisha Shrines that have been designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites. While access to Okinoshima Island and the shrine there is strictly forbidden, the other two Taisha shrines are open to visitors. Many of the treasures found on Okinoshima Island are now housed at the largest and most easily accessible of the three shrines, Hetsu-miya Shrine in Munakata City.\n### Itoshima summer living\nTo the west of Fukuoka is the Itoshima Peninsula, the main summer destination for locals. On the peninsula's northern shore are some world class beaches, an active surfing scene, and Meoto Iwa, the sacred wedded rocks. To the south lie dramatic mountains, great hikes and the thundering cascades of the Shiraito Waterfall.\n### Fire and music festivals\nNumerous festivals take place throughout the prefecture and are a short journey from Fukuoka City. January's Daizenji Fire Festival in Kurume City is one of Japan's three biggest fire festivals, while the summer's Sunset Live Festival sees tens of thousands of people descend on the beaches of Itoshima for two days of live music. Dazaifu Tenmangu Shrine hosts numerous festivals throughout the year, the best of which recreates a Heian-period court ritual."}

The city is the fastest growing in Japan and has engaged in cultural exchange throughout its history from its proximity to mainland Asia.\n### Don't Miss\n- Fukuoka City has some of Japan's best food, and tonkotsu ramen is especially popular\n- Fukuoka hosts Dontaku, Japan's largest festival, and various other festivals\n- Fukuoka's compact size makes it a great place to enjoy both the sea and the mountains\n## How to Get There\nFukuoka is easily accessible from both Tokyo and Osaka via direct shinkansen or air. Fukuoka is well-connected by sea (of which there are various vessels) and air to South Korea (about one hour) and is a short flight from Taiwan and Shanghai (about two hours by direct flight).\nFrom Tokyo, it is about one hour and 45 minutes from Haneda Airport to Fukuoka Airport. The train journey from Tokyo Station to Hakata Station via the JR Tokaido-Sanyo Shinkansen Line is about five hours.\nFlights from Osaka's Itami Airport to Fukuoka Airport take one hour and 15 minutes. The shinkansen ride from Shin-Osaka to Hakata Station is around two hours and 20 minutes.\n### A tale of two cities\nFukuoka is Japan's fifth largest city and is nestled on the northern coast of Kyushu. The city is loosely divided into two halves, Hakata and Tenjin, with the island of Nakasu in the middle. Formerly these areas used to be two separate cities: the merchant town of Hakata to the east and the castle town of Fukuoka (which included Tenjin) to the west. The cities merged in 1889 to create the modern city of Fukuoka.\nNowadays, Hakata is Fukuoka's business hub and is the terminus for the bullet train line that runs from Tokyo.\nHakata Station is one of Fukuoka's main transport hubs, and the airport is only six minutes away by subway. The Tenjin area is Fukuoka's cultural center, with a million and one boutique shops, restaurants and bars. Nakasu, meanwhile, is a glitzy part of the city that truly comes to life after dark.\nThe city is actually closer to Seoul and Shanghai than it is to Tokyo, meaning many visitors to Japan never make it to Fukuoka. However, if you're looking for a more relaxed city to spend some time in than Tokyo, Kyoto or Osaka, Fukuoka is for you.\n### Delicious ramen and fish dishes\nFukuoka is renowned across Japan for its good and cheap food. A bowl of tonkotsu ramen here will set you back as little as 280 yen in some restaurants, while the city's street-side yatai stalls draw crowds from across Japan and Asia. If you're a fan of sushi and sashimi, then you must try goma saba (mackerel), a Fukuoka specialty.\n### Festival fun\nThe Hakata Dontaku Festival is held every year in May during Golden Week. It is the most popular Golden Week festival in Japan, with 2 to 3 million people attending the festival every year. The Hakata Gion Yamakasa, held each July, sees one-ton floats being raced through the streets of Hakata. Besides these two giants, many festivals take place throughout the year within the city and in the surrounding areas.\n### Getting around\nThe city has good local public transport with a rapid subway system and well-connected local buses. For more regional travel within Kyushu and Japan, Hakata Station is the main point of focus, with a large bus terminal and Fukuoka City's bullet train station.\nThe airport is conveniently located, and travel to the city center by subway from the domestic terminal takes only five to six minutes. Regular bus services also run to the airport, connecting it to both the city and the rest of Kyushu.\nThe Hakata Port International Terminal connects the city to some of Kyushu's most remote islands and internationally to South Korea, with a regular ferry service to the Korean City of Busan that takes as little as two hours.\n### Gateway to Kyushu\nMany who come to Fukuoka City use it as the gateway city to see all Kyushu. The city is well-connected to other major cities in Kyushu such as Nagasaki, Kagoshima, Beppu, and Kumamoto. Bus services run to these cities from both the Hakata and Tenjin Bus Terminals, while local and long distance trains through Kyushu run from Hakata JR Station. Many connections within Fukuoka Prefecture are available through the use of local transport services including the local bus, train, and subway lines.\n### Breathtaking beaches and mountains\nFukuoka's relatively small size means that it is incredibly easy to get out to the nearby mountains and beaches. Seaside Momochi includes one of Fukuoka's main attractions, Fukuoka Tower. Meanwhile, during the summer, locals flock to the nearby Itoshima Peninsula for BBQs, swimming and water sports. Itoshima is home to a number of hikes.\n### Kyushu's seat of government for five centuries\nBuilt back in the 7th century, the quiet little town of Dazaifu was once Kyushu's administrative heart. The ruins of the government offices are still here, as are many major temples and shrines such as Tenmangu and Kanzeonji. Tenmangu is the top shrine dedicated to scholars and scholarship and enshrines Sugawara Michizane (845-903), considered the god of academic achievement. This is where students facing exams come to pray for success."}

The name Kitakyushu literally translates to 'north Kyushu.' From the Meiji Era onwards, the city has played a vital role as one of Kyushu's main industrial hubs.\nAs the closest city to Japan's main island of Honshu, Kitakyushu is the gateway between the two islands and is packed with sightseeing spots.\n### Don't Miss\n- Kokura Castle: The symbol of Kitakyushu City, Kokura Castle has an elegant five-story keep and was built in 1602\n- The Moji Port Retro Area: Home to a number of 19th-century historic buildings\n- Night views: The entire city can be seen from up high from the viewpoint of Mt. Sarakura\n## How to Get There\nJR Kokura is Kitakyushu's main station and is on both local and bullet train lines.\nBy bullet train, Kokura is about 15 minutes from Hakata Station in Fukuoka City. From Kokura Station, local trains and buses connect to the rest of the city.\nKitakyushu is serviced internationally by air, and the airline StarFlyer is headquartered at the city's Kitakyushu Airport.\n### Kitakyushu City\nKitakyushu became a city in 1963, though its history extends well beyond this. The city sits on the north coast of Kyushu, next to the Kammon Straits, and is best known as a major industrial employer within Fukuoka Prefecture, but there are also many sightseeing spots to be found across the city.\n### Kokura Castle\nKokura Castle is a well-restored castle that has become a symbol of Kitakyushu and is the only standing castle keep in Fukuoka Prefecture. Surrounding the castle is the Kokura Castle Japanese Garden, which exhibits the history of Japanese manners, and Yasaka Shrine. Together, the two are in Katsuyama Park. The park is home to hundreds of cherry trees that transform the look of Kokura Castle each April during sakura season.\n### The Moji Port retro area\nMoji Port is home to a number of historic buildings that survive from the late 19th century. In 1889, the port was designated a \"special trade port\" due to its proximity to China and its importance as a coal exporting hub.\n### Mojiko Retro Observation Room\nThe port flourished, with a number of financial institutions and merchant companies settling in the area and constructing western-style buildings.\nThe area is also home to the Idemitsu Museum of Arts and the Mojiko Retro Observation Room. This observation point provides great views of the Moji Port Area, the city of Shimonoseki and the Kanmon Straits.\n### Must-see museums\nOne of Japan's most notable companies, TOTO, was founded in Kitakyushu and visitors can see the company's most innovative products at the TOTO Museum in Kokura-kita, dedicated to all things bathroom-related. Also worth a visit is the Kitakyushu Museum of Natural History and Human History in Yahata-higashi, which tracks the course of evolution on Earth with particular reference to the prehistoric evolution of Kyushu.\n### Natural wonders\nTo the south of Kitakyushu, on the border with Oita Prefecture, is Mt. Hiko. Mt. Hiko is one of Kyushu's enjoyable hikes and is located about an hour's drive from the cities of Fukuoka and Kitakyushu. Hikosan, as it is called in Japanese, was the center of training for the Shugendo mountain asceticism, and is famous for Hikosan Jingu Shrine.\nThe largest of these, Hohei-den, is the most majestic. The mountain is particularly beautiful in late autumn, as the colors of the forest change from green to red.\n### Encased by innumerable wisteria\nTo the southwest of Kitakyushu is the Kawachi Fujien Wisteria Garden. The garden is famous for its large wisteria trellis and wisteria tunnels, the centerpiece of the park. The gardens open to the public twice a year—once during the wisteria season in spring, and once during the maple season in fall.\n### Nighttime views\nAbout a 25-minute drive from the Kawachi Fujien Wisteria Garden, to the southwest of Kitakyushu, is Mt. Sarakura. The view from the mountain has been chosen as one of the three \"new great night views of Japan,\" and the \"100 best night views of Japan.\" The mountain can be hiked on foot, and there is also a slope car and cable car available from Hobashira Park. The mountain offers views over Kitakyushu and towards Japan's main island of Honshu."}

The area they occupy is home to a number of great attractions that make a visit well-worth your while.\n### Don't Miss\n- Kurume: A city in the southwest of Fukuoka Prefecture, notable for its shrines, temples and local crafts\n- Yanagawa: The water city, explorable by boat with a trip through the city's ancient canals\n- Akizuki Castle Town: The historic home of the Akizuki family, the leaders of a once-mighty clan that ruled over much of Fukuoka Prefecture\n## How to Get There\nThe southern part of Fukuoka is accessible by train and bus.\nBoth Kurume and Yanagawa can be reached by train, and bus services operate from within Fukuoka Prefecture and elsewhere in Kyushu.\n### Castle town Kurume\nKurume is a city in the south of Fukuoka Prefecture, on the banks of the Chikugo River. It is a former castle town surrounded by the Minou Mountain Range. There are many notable temples and shrines in Kurume including Suiten-gu Shrine, Bairinji Temple, and the Daihonzan Naritasan Kurume Temple.\nSeveral Japanese crafts are also local to the area, including Kurume Kasuri and Rantai lacquerware. In late April to early May, the city explodes with color as the city's favorite flower, the azalea, blooms across Kurume.\n### Water city Yanagawa\nYanagawa is commonly referred to as the water city because of to its 930 km of waterways, which visitors to the city can explore on boats known as donkobune. The city is located close to the mouth of the Chikugo River, which feeds the waterways.\n### Go with the flow in Yanagawa\nYanagawa's historic waterways have been transformed from the defenses of a castle town into sightseeing waterways that can be explored by a cruise. An oarsman with a long pole pushes the boats along the waterways, offering commentary on the city's impressive history and singing nursery rhymes penned by the local poet Hakushu Kitahara. Many of Yanagawa's festivals, including the Hakushu Festival in November and the Ohina-sama Water Parade in March, center around the waterways and the boats atop them.\n### Enjoy cherry blossoms in Akizuki\nAkizuki was the historic home of the Akizuki family, the leaders of a once mighty clan that ruled over much of Fukuoka Prefecture. The small castle town is packed with history and can be explored on foot.\nMuch of the city is organized around the castle and the main boulevard leading to it, Sugi-no-Baba. On this street, you'll find the Akizuki Museum, several tea houses including the excellent Kuromonchaya, the ruins of the Akizuki Castle and one of the most marvelous displays of cherry blossoms in Fukuoka Prefecture. The entire street is lined with cherry trees which, come the beginning of spring, bloom in unison.\n### Relax at Chikugogawa Onsen\nWhere there is water in Japan, there are frequently hot springs. Chikugogawa Onsen is located in the Chikugo River Prefectural Nature Park in southwest Fukuoka Prefecture, about 45 minutes from Kurume City.\nThe bathhouse has several different types of baths, including several which have views out across the river. It has a restaurant and several rooms so that visitors from the city can spend the night relaxing in comfort."}

The prefecture is incredibly active geologically and is home to the great volcanoes of Mt. Kirishima and Mt. Sakurajima. A beneficial side effect of these volcanoes is a number of fantastic hot spring (onsen) facilities that range from traditional baths to beachside sand baths in the shadow of Sakurajima. Island life is one of the charms of Kagoshima Prefecture, and any visitor should consider spending as much time as possible off the mainland.\n## How to Get There\nThe city of Kagoshima is the capital and main transport hub, connected to the rest of Kyushu by the Kyushu Shinkansen to Fukuoka’s Hakata station. The prefecture is home to Kyushu’s second-largest airport, Kagoshima Airport, which connects it both domestically and internationally.\nThe fastest way to reach Kagoshima from Tokyo or Osaka is by air, although the Tokaido-Sanyo Shinkansen also connects Tokyo to Fukuoka in a little over five hours.

Due to the ash fall from Mt. Sakurajima's eruptions, Kagoshima's soil is not suitable for growing rice or wheat. Sweet potatoes, however, proved hardy enough to grow here, and the area developed as a major producer of a type of sweet potato known as \"satsumaimo.\" Shochu made from this variety of sweet potato is characterized by its elegant and refined sweetness.\n- Karukan\nMade from a dough of rice flour, grated yam and sugar formed into dumplings and filled with sweet bean paste, karukan are then steamed into a delicious, spongy cake. Great for teatime.\n- Kagoshima Black Beef\nJapanese black wagyu cattle raised in the sunshine of Kagoshima are the most numerous of all Japanese wagyu breeds. The beef they yield is known for its tenderness, rich meaty flavor and well-balanced marbling, and is increasingly being rated as the highest grade of wagyu. A must for lovers of premium-quality steak.\n- Satsuma Ware\nKagoshima is known as a heaven for pottery lovers.

You'll find everything from exquisite fine art pieces to everyday use tableware and items for home decor.\n- Oshima Tsumugi Silk\nOshima Tsumugi is a woven silk fabric. Traditional production techniques developed around 1,300 years ago on Amami-Oshima Island. Dyeing it with mud and bark is a technique unique to the Amami region. A bolt of this wrinkle-resistant ikat can take a year to make.\n## Seasonal Highlights\n- Spring\nThe area around the ruins of Tsurumaru Castle (Kagoshima Castle) is covered with cherry blossoms in full bloom. Spring is also the best time to visit Yakushima Island, a World Natural Heritage site, as it rains less than usual at this time of year.\n- Summer\nKagoshima offers some of Japan's best spots for marine activities, including diving, snorkeling and surfing at Amami-Oshima and its surrounding islands. Sea turtles can be observed nesting at Nagahata Inakahama Beach on Yakushima, the largest sea turtle spawning ground in Japan.\n- Autumn\nIn autumn, tens of thousands of cranes sweep into the Izumi Crane Observation Center, which boasts the largest number of migrating cranes in Japan. Visitors can also enjoy a volcanic sand bath at the onsen resort in Ibusuki.\n- Winter\nWinter is the perfect time to relax in the soothing waters of Kirishima Onsen, home to over a dozen different hot spring baths. It is also an excellent time to visit Ibusuki Onsen in the southern part of the Kagoshima mainland for its steaming sand baths. You can lie on the beach in this natural sauna and enjoy the scenery. The view of Mt. Kaimondake from the beach, also known as Satsuma Fuji, is a beautiful sight."}

Ferry services regularly leave to both Kagoshima and Okinawa, while the airport links the island to Tokyo. Most smaller inhabited islands have regional flights to Kagoshima in Kyushu and Naha in Okinawa.\n### Amami-Oshima Island\nAmami-Oshima is the largest of the Amami Islands. The island is part of the Amamigunto National Park, and the sea surrounding the island is crystal clear. The brightly colored coral reefs and tropical fish make for fantastic diving opportunities. Amami-Oshima was registered as a UNESCO World Natural Heritage site in July 2021 for its biodiversity, and the rare endemic animals and plants that have evolved independently over a long time.\nOshima tsumugi silk is a specialty of the Amami Islands and has been used for about 1,300 years to make high-quality kimono. The unique dyeing techniques using mud, along with the weaving techniques, colors and the motifs inspired by the nature of the islands, makes this fabric highly sought-after.\n### Tokunoshima Island\nThe second-largest of the Amami Islands, Tokunoshima is home to a rare form of bullfighting known as bovine sumo or togyu. While the idea of bullfighting conjures up images of matadors and bloodied opponents, this event sees bull pitted against bull in a short fight for dominance. Togyu has been practiced on the island for over 500 years.\nThe second-largest of the Amami Islands, Tokunoshima is also registered as a UNESCO World Natural Heritage site with Amami-Oshima island. Tokunoshima is home to a rare form of bullfighting known togyu (bull sumo). While the idea of Spanish bullfighting conjures up images of matadors and bloodied opponents, this event sees heavy class bulls, weighing from 700kg to 1t, pitted against each other in a short fight for dominance. Togyu has been practiced on the island for about 500 years.\nTokunoshima has a beautiful coral coastline, and the island's beaches have few rivals. You'll enjoy good surf as well as crystal-clear snorkeling and scuba diving. Each June the island hosts an annual triathlon that is open to everyone.\n### Okinoerabu Island\nThere are between 200 and 300 limestone caves on the island of Okinoerabu. The natural beauty of the caves makes them a must-see destination.\nLike many of the Amami Islands, Okinoerabu is a coral island, great for snorkeling and diving. Unique flora and fauna are in abundant supply and include turtles, sea snakes, sea cucumbers, starfish, octopus, stingrays and reef sharks.\n### Yoron Island\nYoron Island is the southernmost of the Amami Islands,and it takes only about 40 minutes from Okinawa by air. Yoron is tiny, measuring about 23 square kilometers, and has a population of about 5,000 people.\n### Language\nDue to the islands' separation from mainland Japan and their strong association with the other Ryukyu Islands, the people of the Amami Islands chain historically spoke a dialect of Japanese that is almost unrecognizable to speakers of standard Japanese. This local dialect is one of the attractions of these islands.\n### Food and drink\nKeihan is a popular local dish and literally translates to chicken rice. The basic formula is simple (chicken on a bed of rice covered in chicken broth), but the exact presentation differs across the islands. Usually, keihan will include a mixture of sliced omelet, ginger, green onion, shiitake mushrooms and dried seaweed.\nKeihan is a popular local dish, which usually includes a mixture of flank steak, sliced omelet, green onion, shiitake mushrooms and pickled papaya. It is said that the Showa Emperor (1926–1989) acclaimed keihan on a visit to the islands.\nAcross the Amami Islands, they drink kokuto shochu, distilled from sugar cane grown commercially on the islands rather than the usual base of sweet potatoes, rice, barley or buckwheat that is typical on the Japanese mainland."}

Kaimon—known as Satsuma Fuji for its resemblance to Japan's most iconic mountain, Mt. Fuji.\n### Don't Miss\n- Detoxing at Ibusuki Sunamushi Onsen\n- Hike to the top of Mt. Kaimon for an amazing view\n- Enjoy blooming flowers and stunning coastal views at Flower Park Kagoshima\n## How to Get There\nIbusuki is easily accessible from Kagoshima-Chuo Station by train.\nYou can take a 50-minute limited express or an 80-minute local train. The Ibusuki no Tamatebako limited express theme train is particularly recommended for a unique travel experience.\n### Buried in the sand\nIbusuki is famous for its hot sand baths by the seaside. It is a unique spa where you can lie in a sand pit and be buried up to your neck in sand that is heated by hot springs. There are plenty of regular onsen as well, and the rotenburo outdoor bath at Healthy Land Tamatebako onsen provides amazing views of Mt Kaimon. At Unagi Onsen, on the shore of Unagi-ike Pond, you can experience a traditional hot spring bath that has been around since the Edo period (1603-1867).\nSome of the many natural onsen venting steam in Ibusuki\nThe beautiful, conical Mt. Kaimon\n### Conquering the peak\nConquering the peak\nIf you're looking for an active experience, consider climbing to the top of Mt. Kaimon. On a clear day, the views of Yakushima and Osumi Peninsula are spectacular. The dormant volcano is 924 meters high and has a beautiful, conical shape. The hike follows a gentle spiral path and can be completed in about 2.5 to 3 hours one way.\nIf you just want to relax and enjoy the scenery, picture-perfect views of the volcano can also be seen at Japan's southernmost station, JR Nishi Oyama Station. There is a yellow postbox nearby that is said to bring happiness. Make a wish for happiness and be sure to drop off your potcards to send home here.\n### Botanical beauty by the sea\nYou can find pleasant views of the coastline and some 2,400 species of tropical and subtropical plants and flowers at Flower Park Kagoshima. Explore the vast park which covers around 36.5 hectares and discover a huge variety of plant life as you bask in the natural beauty of the place.\nFurther inland is Lake Ikeda, the largest crater lake in Kyushu. The lake is inhabited by large eels, some of which can grow up to two meters in length. This lake is said to be the home of a monster called Issie, though as with its Scottish cousin Nessie, its existence has yet to be verified. The canola blossoms along the lakeshore are particularly pretty in spring.\n### Tradition and culture\nStop by the Satsuma Denshokan museum to find out all about the local history of Kagoshima, with a focus on the highly intricately decorated Satsuma ware pottery. This style of pottery made a lasting impression in Europe at the end of the 19th century, and it is easy to see why when looking at the stunning pieces on display in the museum.\n### Catch them if you can\nNo visit to Ibusuki would be complete without eating the local specialty, somen nagashi. At Tosenkyo Somen Nagashi, noodles in a circular container in the middle of your table are spun around by flowing water. Catching the noodles with your chopsticks is a challenge, but the reward is delicious. Lefties can choose to reverse the flow of the water to make the noodles easier to grab hold of."}

Local trains and buses are also available from neighboring prefectures.\nDomestic flights operate from most major locations, including Tokyo (2 hours), Osaka (1 hour 15 minutes) and Fukuoka (55 minutes). Regular international flights operate from Seoul, Hong Kong, Taipei, and Shanghai.\n### In the shadow of Sakurajima\nActive volcano Sakurajima towers over the city and is only a short ferry ride away if you want to get up close and personal with this monument to the power of nature. You can cycle around the volcano, and there is a museum where you can learn all about the volcano.\n### Get the best views of Sakurajima\nYou can find the best views of Sakurajima at the picturesque Japanese garden Sengan-en and on top of the Shiroyama viewpoint, which rises up behind the city. Take note, you may also get a light showering of ash if the volcano erupts, which it frequently does.\n### Southern Japanese samurai\nVisit the ruins of Kagoshima castle to step back in time and feel how the lords of the Shimazu clan and their samurai lived. Kagoshima samurai played a pivotal role in the end of the Tokugawa clan and indeed samurai rule of Japan in 1867.\n### Take a leisurely walk around the old castle grounds\nStart at Terukuni-jinja shrine, where revered feudal lord Shimazu Nariakira is enshrined. Then head over to get your photo taken with the statue of the real last samurai, Saigo Takamori. Take a leisurely stroll past the old castle walls, and head inside the former castle grounds to visit the Reimeikan Museum and learn about the rich history and culture of Kagoshima.\n### Ishibashi Park\nTake a stroll around Ishibashi Park, where the old stone bridges of Kagoshima City have been tastefully displayed. A small man-made river makes a great paddling pool for younger children in the warmer months.\n### Swim with dolphins during summer\nDuring the summer you can also enjoy a swim at nearby Iso Beach, which is also frequented by windsurfers and jet-skiers. If you are lucky, you may even see dolphins playing in the sea in front of the volcano.\n### Journey through the historic Sengan-en\nMake sure to leave plenty of time for a visit to Sengan-en, the former private residence of the feudal lords of the Satsuma domain. The expansive grounds include the house and gardens as well as a museum and glassworks.\n### A view of the deep\nThe view of the volcano is certainly impressive, but what goes on underneath the surface of the sea is equally so. You can take a look at the kind of creatures that might be lurking deep beneath the surface in Kinko Bay in the huge Aira Caldera at the Io World aquarium.\n### Living it large with the locals\nKagoshima is famous for its food and drink, and what better way to enjoy it than in the company of locals in one of downtown Tenmonkan's many great bars and restaurants. Hop on a tram and make your way through the city to the main nightspots, or take it easy in a restaurant nestled in one of the many inviting backstreets.\n### Devour famous dishes and special local shochu\nJapan might be famous for sushi, but Kagoshima really brings home the bacon with its famous kurobuta pork, award-winning wagyu beef, and kurosatsuma-dori (black chicken). Head down to Tenmonkan to sample local shochu. Don't worry about missing the last train, the nightlife in Kagoshima goes on late into the night."}

Reinvigorate yourself in healing hot springs and enjoy the fresh mountain air.\n### Don't Miss\n- Hiking trails that overlook breathtaking mountain views\n- Relaxing volcanic hot springs\n- Majestic Kirishima-jingu Shrine\n- Kirishima Open Air Museum\n## How to Get There\nKirishima can be reached by train and bus. Renting a car to tour the area is also a viable option.\nKirishima is located northeast of Kagoshima City on the border with Miyazaki Prefecture. It can be reached via a one-hour local train or a 50-minute limited express train from Kagoshima Chuo Station.\nKirishima is accessible by bus from Kagoshima Airport, but renting a car is perhaps the best method to get the most out of your visit to Kirishima.\n### Picturesque mountain views\nKirishima has a network of hiking trails that range from gentle to reasonably challenging and will take you to the roof of Kyushu and what is reportedly the point of the genesis of Japan. According to Japanese mythology, the god Ninigi no Mikoto descended to Earth at Mt. Takachiho and thrust his three-pronged spear into the mountaintop, bringing peace to the land.\nKirishima Onsen Hot Spring Resort\nThe Kirishima ridge trail is a 12-kilometer course along the main mountain ridge that takes about six hours to complete. On the way, you will pass by some of the most breathtaking mountain scenery in Japan, including picturesque views of Onami Lake.\nThe area is well known for its many deer, and you will likely spot them roaming through the foliage as you walk the hills. Plan your route and check transport times for your journey back.\n### Relax in volcanic waters\nAfter a long hike, take a rest in one of the many hot springs found in the area. Kirishima Onsen is one of Japan's best-known hot spring resorts and is located high in the mountains. Stay at one of the many traditional inns or ryokan in the area and soak in the healing waters. It's a wonderful way to rejuvenate your mind and body while breathing in the invigorating mountain air.\n### The first samurai honeymoon\nSamurai rebel Sakamoto Ryoma and his wife Oryo Kirishima visited Kirishima after he was wounded in the 1866 battle at the Teradaya Inn in Kyoto. This has since been called Japan's first honeymoon, although perhaps somewhat less romantic than what we are used to today. You can retrace the route Ryoma and his wife walked, which is popular for onsen-loving history buffs.\n### Ancient shrines\nIt is easy to see why Kirishima-jingu Shrine is called the Nikko of the West, with its impressively decorated vermilion pavilions. Ancient trees loom over the shrine complex and give a sense of mystery to this sacred site. Make sure to walk around the back of the main shrine and take one of the winding trails to peaceful smaller shrines often overlooked by visitors.\nSlightly off the beaten track, you'll find the impressive Kagoshima-jingu Shrine, said to have been founded by the first Japanese emperor, Jimmu. Be sure to check out the beautifully decorated roof of the main hall.\n### Art on a mountainside\nThe Kirishima Open Air Museum, located halfway up Mt. Kurino, has a number of modern installations from close to two dozen Japanese and overseas artists, including Yayoi Kusama and Anthony Gormley. Many of the displays are outdoors, creating endless photo opportunities that even the youngest visitors can enjoy."}

This little island is the country's first UNESCO World Heritage site, the inspiration for Studio Ghibli's film \"Princess Mononoke\" and home to some of the best natural wonders in Japan.\n### Don't Miss\n- The waterfalls—Yakushima's wet climate and steep terrain means it has an abundance of enormous waterfalls\n- Ancient forests—Yakushima is home to yakusugi, ancient cedar trees, the oldest of which is thought to be 7,000 years old\n- Sea turtle season—from May to July every year, Nagata Inaka Beach becomes a major sea turtle nesting site\n## How to Get There\nJust 60 kilometers off the tip of Kagoshima, Yakushima can be accessed by plane or ferry.\nFrom Tokyo, take a plane from Haneda Airport to Kagoshima Airport. The flight is less than two hours. From there, a connecting flight to Yakushima is only 40 minutes. Another option is to take a ferry from Kagoshima Port to Yakushima Miyanoura or Anobo Port. The ferry ride takes two and a half hours on the speed ferry or four hours on the regular, and cheaper, car ferry.\n### Remoteness is a positive thing\nNot as easily accessible as other parts of Japan, Yakushima has remained relatively untouched. In 1993, the island was registered as a UNESCO World Heritage site. Its pristine coastline and crystal-clear waters attract tourists from across Japan, and yet its remote location means that the island never feels too touristy.\nYakushima was Japan's first-ever inscription on the UNESCO World Heritage list, alongside Shirakami Sanchi in Tohoku.\nAbout 90 percent of the island is mountainous and forested. Its highest point, the peak of Mt. Miyanoura, is the highest mountain in Kyushu at 1,936 meters. Mt. Miyanoura is situated in the middle of the island, surrounded by many other mountains exceeding 1,500 meters.\n### Natural variation\nFrom the island's sandy beaches to the upper reaches of its highest mountains, Yakushima is home to a range of microclimates that vary from subtropical to subarctic. This variation has resulted in the presence of extraordinary biodiversity. With its abundance of rainfall throughout the year, the island is covered with lush green forests which are home to many yakusugi trees (ancient cedar trees), some of which are over 1,000 years old.\nNoteworthy attractions include the Shiratani Unsuikyo Ravine, Yakusugi Land, and Nagata Inaka Beach. Shiratani Unsuikyo Ravine is filled with beautiful valleys and primeval forests, while Yakusugi Land is home to a collection of enormous yakusugi trees. And Nagata Inaka Beach is Japan's largest sea turtle nesting site.\n### An ancient tree\nIn the middle of the island, only accessible by hiking four to five hours one way is the Jomon Sugi. The Jomon Sugi is said to be around 7,000 years old. The enormous tree derives its name from the Jomon Period of Japanese pre-history, and its discovery in 1966 raised awareness of the need to protect valuable forest resources.\n### Water falling\nThe steep terrain, high elevations and abundance of rainfall mean that Yakushima has many waterfalls. Okonotaki Falls is a roaring, 88-meter waterfall that is one of the highlights of Yakushima, and was selected as one of Japan's best waterfalls in 1990. Senpironotaki Falls, Torokinotaki Falls, and Janokuchi Falls are some of the island's other popular and accessible waterfalls.\n### Human wonders\nThe Yakushima Goshinzan Festival is held on the Miyanoura River and is a unique event with links to the cult of the mountain god. Those gathered at the site are sprinkled with sacred water to pray for good health and family safety. A bonfire is then built to welcome the mountain deities, and a magnificent Yakushima taiko drum is dedicated to the deities.\n### Around we go\nYakushima has one major ring road that goes the entire way around the island. Buses run regularly along this route, but due to the remote nature of many of the island's attractions, private transport is recommended to get around quickly. There are rental agencies near Miyanoura Port, Awa Port, and Yakushima Airport.\n### Local eats\nYakushima produces much of its own food and has several specialties. Chief amongst them is flying fish, which is a delicious lunch or dinner treat.\nMany shops sell bento lunch boxes wrapped in environmentally friendly bamboo leaves.\nThe local shochu is also worth a try. The most famous brand is called Mitake and comes in 25 percent and 39 percent varieties."}

Aso is known for its huge caldera containing villages and farms. Kumamoto Castle is one of the country's most imposing, and Kurokawa Onsen retains a quaint, traditional feel.\n## How to Get There\nKumamoto has its own airport, and larger Fukuoka Airport is also close. Bullet trains pass through Kumamoto as well, with easy access from Kagoshima in the south, and Fukuoka and beyond to the north. Local trains are cheap and convenient for reaching small towns around Kumamoto Prefecture.\nThere are direct flights to Kumamoto Airport from Tokyo’s Haneda Airport and Osaka’s Itami Airport. There are also direct flights from Narita, Nagoya (both Chubu and Komaki), and Shizuoka. If traveling from elsewhere in Japan, the best way to get to the area is by catching a plane to nearby Fukuoka Airport and then getting to Kumamoto by train or bus.

It has a rich, nutty flavor, and can be enjoyed straight up, on the rocks or mixed into cocktails.\n- Dekopon\nThe dekopon is a hybrid mandarin often called the \"sumo mandarin\" due to its large, round size. Incredibly sweet and packed with juice. Make sure to try fresh-squeezed dekopon juice while in Kumamoto.\n- Bamboo Crafts\nKumamoto has a lot of bamboo, and its artisans sculpt it into various fantastic shapes, including lanterns, candleholders, baskets and other decorative and practical items.

Although most people today visit Amakusa to enjoy the area's rustic beauty and marine activities, history buffs interested in this period will find plenty to discover in the area's numerous museums and churches.\n### Don't Miss\n- Dolphin-spotting cruises in the bay\n- Museums on Christianity's tumultuous and secret history in Amakusa\n- Sampling the local delicacy: sea urchin\n## How to Get There\nAmakusa is accessible via plane, ferry, or bus.\nDaily flights for Amakusa Airport depart from Osaka, Fukuoka, and Kumamoto, and hourly buses depart from Kumamoto Station. However, the ferry is by far the most scenic option. Ferries are available from Kuchinotsu Port in Nagasaki, Kuranomoto in Kagoshima, and Misumi East Port in Kumamoto (the best option for JR Rail Pass holders).\nFor Misumi, take the JR Misumi Line from Kumamoto Station to Misumi Station; Misumi East Port is just outside the station. Catch the Amakusa Takarajima Ferry to Amakusa's main island of Shimoshima. Even in peak times, this boat is rarely packed and offers unrivaled views of the islands. If you have extra time before departure, consider taking a 10-minute bus or taxi to Misumi West Port, which has well-preserved historic buildings that are open to the public.\nOnce in Amakusa, a rental car is the best option for exploring the island, as buses are infrequent.\n### An ocean lover's paradise\nAmakusa and its surrounding islands offer an abundance of beaches, hot springs, and marine activities like fishing, scuba, snorkeling, wakeboarding and more.\nNearby Goshoura Island is referred to as the \"island of dinosaurs\" and has a host of museums and fossil sites to explore, while the islands of Tsukinoshima and Hogashima offer glass-bottom boat rides.\n### All aboard the dolphin cruise\nAmakusa consists of more than 120 islands of various sizes, the biggest of which are Shimoshima Island and Ueshima Island. The islands are a natural habitat for wild dolphins. As such, the number one tourist attraction in Amakusa is dolphin spotting.\nThere are many cruise providers in the area, such as the Sea Cruise Company and the Dolphin Cruise Company.\n### Enjoy the ride\nGetting a great photo of the dolphins is almost impossible, so sit back and enjoy the experience. Dolphin sightings are practically guaranteed, with a 98% success rate. The tours are most popular in the summer, but operate year-round, weather permitting.\n### Temple of secrets\nMyotokuji is one of the Zen Buddhist temples in Amakusa built in 1645 in an attempt to persuade the local Christians to convert to Buddhism. Following the Shimabara Rebellion (1637-8), there was still much resistance by local Christians and persecution continued until the 1850s.\nYou can learn more about this history at the nearby Christian Museum.\n### A history of rebellion\nThe Shimabara Rebellion of 1637 saw thousands of Christians massacred following a long period of famine, taxation and persecution. The rebellious leader, the charismatic sixteen-year-old Amakusa Shiro, was killed in battle by the governing Shogunate forces, but became a revered hero who is still memorialized today. In the aftermath of the rebellion, Christianity was prohibited, and harsh measures were taken to convert Christians back to the official religion of Buddhism.\nDespite this, large numbers of Christians persisted in Amakusa and the area has remained one of the most Christian regions of Japan to this day.\n### Coming out of hiding\nIn 1933, the Romanesque church Oe Cathedral was built by Father Garnier, a French missionary, following the lifting of the ban on Christianity in 1873. Below the church, you'll find the Amakusa Rosario Museum, which exhibits items related to the secret lives of the hidden Christians.\nNearby is Sakitsu Church, a Catholic church built in 1934. Although the building is in the Gothic style, some of the interior is covered with tatami mats, blending in with the lifestyle of the fishing village. The church has been nominated for UNESCO heritage status alongside several other notable sites in Nagasaki Prefecture.\n### While you're at it\nDon't miss the Amakusa Collegio Museum, which explores the history of the area before the Shimabara Rebellion and features a life-sized model of Japan's first printing press.\nOther attractions on Shimoshima that aren't related to Amakusa's turbulent past include plenty of beaches, parks and hiking trails. The Shimodo Onsen area on the western side of Shimoshima offers traditional ryokan (Japanese inn) accommodation for those hoping to spend more than a day exploring the islands."}

Sometimes called Kyushu's \"Little Kyoto,\" the town is nowadays known for its river boat cruises, Kyushu's largest limestone caves, local distillery, and castle ruins.\n### Don't Miss\n- Cruising along the Kumagawa River, a one-of-a-kind way to see the area\n- Aoi Aso-jinja Shrine, a National Treasure with beautiful thatched roofs\n- Visiting the ruins of Hitoyoshi Castle, which combines Japanese and Western architectural features\n- Touring the Sengetsu Shuzo Distillery to sample locally brewed shochu\n## How to Get There\nIt takes about an hour from Kumamoto City by car (using the expressway). Highway bus services are also available.\n### Ride the Kumagawa River\nOld-fashioned wooden boat cruises on the Kumagawa River are the main draw for Japanese and international tourists to Hitoyoshi. With both slow, leisurely cruises and fast, adventure courses to choose from, a day on the river offers something for everyone. You can even get the white-knuckle experience with rafting options available in the summer.\nNote that due to the damage caused by torrential rainfall in July 2020, only the short course (Umehana-no Watashi) is currently in operation; the long course is expected to be in operation from spring 2022.\nWhenever you go, the river is a picturesque place to visit and a photogenic backdrop for holiday snaps.\n### A 300-million-year-old cave\nAnother of Hitoyoshi's main draws is the largest limestone cave in Kyushu. Kysendo Cave runs five kilometers long and is said to be over 300 million years old. A kilometer of the cave is open for public exploration, with 30-minutes required to take in one of the area's more unusual attributes. Please note that it is closed for the time being due to damage from torrential rain in July 2020 (reopening date is undecided.)\n### A national treasure with unique features\nAnother noteworthy attraction in Hitoyoshi is Aoi Aso-jinja, a Shinto shrine with unique thatched roofs reflecting its 1,200-year history. Five of the structures in the shrine (the main shrine, offering hall, oratory, corridor and gate) are listed as National Treasures of Japan.\nThe shrine complex is small, and won't take too much time to see, giving you plenty of time to continue your journey.\n### Local brews\nKyushu is renowned for its shochu, a spirit typically distilled from sweet potato, barley, rice or black sugar. Hitoyoshi is no exception; the Kuma area is home to 28 breweries, with Sengetsu Shuzo Distillery being one of the most famous. The liquor brewed here, Kuma Shochu, makes a great souvenir to take home.\n### The ruins of Hitoyoshi Castle\nAnother of the city's main attractions is the ruins of Hitoyoshi Castle. First built in 1198, the castle was governed by the same family for around 700 years. In 1872 the castle was dismantled, but recent reconstructions have turned this attraction from ruins into a more interesting place to visit. An interesting feature of Hitoyoshi Castle is its reconstructed walls which were built in the hanedashi method. This includes overhanging ramparts copied from European castle construction styles to protect the castle from fires. These hanedashi walls are extremely rare. There are two yagura (towers) and a reconstructed gate to see as well as the ancient castle walls.\nThe Kumagawa River acts as the outer moat of the castle, making it one of the more picturesque castles in the area, and the site ranks among Japan's top 100 castles. The grounds house a museum where you can learn about the castle's history and view its treasures and artifacts. Due to torrential rains in July 2020, note that part of the castle ruins are now off-limits, and the museum is temporarily closed.\n### Exploring more of Hitoyoshi\nOther top attractions in Hitoyoshi include the rail museum (popular with children), the Hitoyoshi onsen (hotsprings), a traditional samurai house called Bukekura, and local parks."}

The disaster caused severe damage to homes and buildings throughout the city including several key attractions. While life goes on as normal, repair work still continues.\n©Kumamoto Castle General Office\n### A castle under repair\nKumamoto Castle, one of Japan's most visited, suffered severe damage in the 2016 earthquake. The restored castle tower is open to the public, but many areas remain inaccessible. Restoration work still continues, but visitors can walk around the castle, stopping at small shrines, gardens, and other tourist attractions along the way.Kato-jinja on the eastern edge of the grounds is a charming shrine and one of few places where you can still view the castle keep.\n©Kumamoto Castle General Office\n### Commitment to art and culture\nClose to the castle, the Kumamoto Prefectural Museum of Art was opened in the 1970s, with further branches opening in 1992 and 2008. As well as paintings, the museum also exhibits lacquerware, calligraphy, ceramic art, sculptures and ancient artifacts. Important works of modern Japanese art are on display, as well as permanent European art exhibits, including works by Rembrandt, Goya, Warhol, Picasso and Renoir.\n### Kumamoto's top festival\nOne of the biggest annual events in the city is the Fujisaki Hachimangu Shrine Grand Autumn Festival. Held in September, it is a vibrant event with competing teams parading a decorated horse between Fujisaki Hachimangu and Gokoku shrines. The procession marches through the center of Kumamoto, down the covered shopping arcade. Revel in the jubilant atmosphere and enjoy music, costumes, and stalls selling snacks and souvenirs.\n### Other city sights\nThere are numerous museums and attractions in the city for travelers to visit. CAMK (Contemporary Art Museum Kumamoto) has a permanent free exhibition and an alternating temporary exhibition. Suizenji Garden is a picturesque landscape garden with a thatch-roof teahouse. Nearby is Lake Ezu, where you can enjoy a long walk by the water's edge or rent a pedalo.\n### Out of town\nFor a short excursion outside of the city center, head to Honmyo-ji, a hilltop temple with views of the city. It is also where the great warrior Kato Kiyomasa (1562-1611), a key figure in the construction of Kumamoto Castle, is laid to rest. A bronze statue of the man stands in the temple grounds.\nFurther out of town in the same direction, Reigando Cave and the hundreds of Buddhist statues leading to it are a curious attraction. The cave was where one of Japan's greatest swordsmen, Miyamoto Musashi, chose to spend the final years of his life after writing his book on the art of war, The Book of Five Rings (Go Rin No Sho).\n### Volcano bound\nA visit to Kumamoto Prefecture is not complete without a trip to Mt. Aso. Buses for Aso leave from Kumamoto Station and drop off at Aso Station from where you transfer to an additional bus to reach the volcanic crater. There are two ways to get to Aso from Kumamoto City: by train or by bus. There are trains from Kumamoto Station to Aso Station. Buses depart for Aso Station from Kumamoto Station or Sakura-machi Bus Terminal. To get to the Mt. Aso Nakadake Crater, change to another bus from Aso Station."}

The flavors range from sweet to hearty to mellow, and adding a bit of hot water makes the fragrance bloom.\n- Miyakonojo Archery Bows\nElegant lines and beautiful details characterize the Miyakonojo daikyu, a longbow crafted for range and accuracy. These bows are handcrafted in Miyakonojo, Japan’s archery capital, which produces 90 percent of Japan’s bamboo bows and hosts an annual martial art competition in archery.\n- Hyuganatsu\nSimilar in appearance to an orange with yellow skin, the hyuganatsu is a juicy citrus fruit with a thick, soft skin.

Mangoes fall off the vine as they ripen, so to increase the amount of ripening and avoid bruising, Miyazaki farmers wrap their sweet and delicious fruits in nets attached to the trees.\n- Hiyajiru\nConsidered one of the hottest areas on the southern island of Kyushu, Miyazaki is the home of hiyajiru, the Japanese version of gazpacho. It is a chilled soup made from dried fish and miso, poured atop cooked rice and eaten alongside refreshing summer vegetables like cucumber. A final topping of ginger and perilla give the dish an extra-refreshing flavor.\n## Seasonal Highlights\n- Spring\nSpring brings new warmth to the ocean’s waters, one of Japan's earliest cherry blossom seasons and the official opening of popular Aoshima Beach Park.\n- Summer\nSummer in Miyazaki means mangos, hiyajiru cold miso soup, and fireworks festivals held up and down the coastline.\n- Autumn\nFall sees leaves turn especially bright at the Gokase Valley, cloudrift at Kunimigaoka in Takachiho, and ideal trekking conditions at the Ebino Plateau.\n- Winter\nWinter illuminations can be enjoyed throughout the prefecture. Mythical kagura dances are performed at Takachiho Shrine this time of year. Coming-of-Age Day, held on the second Monday in January, people go into the sea to perform misogi (a purification ceremony) dressed in special clothing exposing their upper bodies."}

Ebino Plateau, or Ebino Kogen, is in the south-western part of Miyazaki and boasts a 12-kilometer mountain-to-mountain ridge hike.\n### Don't Miss\n- A leisurely stroll around Rokkannonmi Pond\n- The hike along Kirishima's breathtaking 12-kilometer volcanic ridge\n- See if you can spot South Korea from the top of Mt. Karakuni\n## How to Get There\nIf you are coming to the area by car, you can use the expressway and pay a toll, or use local roads. From Miyazaki City, the drive is just over 90 minutes.\n### Hike through Japan's first designated national park\nAny trip to Ebino centers around exploring the Kirishima mountain ranges.\nIf you spend enough time in the area there are 23 volcanoes, 15 craters and ten crater lakes to see, which make the region an absolute fantasyland for volcano lovers and adventurous explorers.\n### Start with a beginner-friendly hike around Rokkannonmi Pond\nThere are many different hikes to enjoy in Ebino, but most travelers start at the visitor center and go around Rokkannonmi Pond. It's a fairly leisurely two-hour hike, with fantastic views of the surrounding mountains and highlands.\n### Tackle the more challenging and spectacular volcanic ridge trail\nIf you want something more challenging, you can take the 12-kilometer Ridge Trail, which leads from Ebino Kogen and takes you over numerous volcanic peaks to the other side of the National Park. Note that if you intend on stopping at the other end, you'll need to organize transport to pick you up.\n### Ascend the peak of Mt. Karakuni\nThe highest of the mountains in the Ebino Kogen area is Mt Karakuni, at 1,700 meters above sea level. It gets its name because you can see all the way to South Korea from the top of the peak on a clear day. If you're lucky enough to be there in the fall season, you can see some amazingly colored trees.\n### Learn more about life in this unique area\nTo learn more about the distinct landscape, flora and fauna that flourishes in the area, pay a visit to the Eco Museum Center at the entrance to Ebino Kogen.

With a coastline that stretches over 300 kilometers, Miyazaki attracts swell from the east, south and north. An abundance of surf schools have opened shop along the coast and, during typhoon season especially, you can find some world-class surf breaks to rival any surf location.\n### Don't Miss\n- Surfing in Aoshima followed by a beer and burger at Aoshima Beach Park\n- Driving south down Route 220 for a surf check\n- Enjoying the Hyuga sunrise before a surf at Okuragahama\n## How to Get There\nLocated on the southeastern coast of Kyushu, Miyazaki is accessible by car and by plane.\nMiyazaki is not accessible by bullet train, so if you're traveling with surfboards, your options to get there are driving or flying.\nIf you are on a budget, from Tokyo's Haneda Airport, the cheapest flights are with Solaseed Air. As of December 2017, Jetstar also flies direct to Miyazaki, but flights are from Narita Airport.\nIf you're driving from Honshu, simply take the Kyushu Expressway and turn onto the Miyazaki Expressway.\n### Surfing in Hyuga\nMiyazaki's surf spots are broken into three geographical areas— Hyuga in the north, Miyazaki City in the center and Nichinan in the south. All three areas offer fun waves for beginners and more challenging waves for skilled surfers.\nThe most famous beach in the Hyuga area is Okuragahama. It's home to numerous international surfing events each year and was the location for the ISA World Junior Surf Championships in 2017. Okuragahama is a sand bottom beach, but it breaks very consistently.\nThe area is easily accessible from Route 10 and has a free carpark. Locals are friendly, but show respect and follow typical surf manners. Most of the surf shops and surf schools operate from this beach.\nKanegahama is the next beach along from Okuragahama, and it also gets whatever swells available. Kanegahama is well-developed and has all the amenities for locals and visitors. This beach makes for great beach walks when the tide's low, and there's not too much swell.\n### Surfing in the Miyazaki City area\nFrom Hyuga, the first place to surf in Miyazaki City is around Hitotsuba. This is where the Phoenix Seagaia Resort and Sheraton Grande Ocean Resort are located.\nThere are a lot of breakwalls here, so you tend to get shorter, punchier waves that barrel a lot. As a result, Hitotsuba is not a great place for beginners, and coming in can be tricky at times, even for more experienced surfers.\nYou can access any of the beaches here by turning off the Hitotsuba Toll Road and finding the short rocky beach tracks that lead to the water's edge.\nHeading further south, you'll reach Kisakihama. This is Miyazaki's most well-known beach and is home to many contests. Nestled between the Kiyotake River and the Kaeda River, Kisakihama offers a long, uninterrupted stretch of beach that gets swell in most conditions. The 2019 ISA World Surfing Games were held here. Down towards the Kiyotake River end tends to be better for shortboarders.\nBeyond Kisakihama, you'll reach Aoshima. It's always a popular surf spot because of the free car park, the amenities, the nearby cafes, and shops. This beach is also walking distance to Aoshima Shrine. The breaks here are suitable for all levels, and there are a lot of surf schools in the area.\n### Surfing in Nichinan\nSouth of Miyazaki City is Nichinan. The trip to Nichinan offers one of the best coastal drives in Kyushu, with breathtaking scenes of volcanic rock formations and towering mountains that overlook the ocean below. What's more, there's an abundance of good surf spots.\nThe first beach in the area is Ibii. A gorgeous little stretch of sand, Ibii is an excellent beach for those just starting to surf because the waves are very manageable. In fact, you'll often find kids and families spending the day here.\nFurther south is Shoujuen. This beach is about 10 minutes past Sunmesse Nichinan. Look for the 7-Eleven on your right and the entrance is directly across the road. Shoujuen is particularly good when the swell is from the north.\nAbout five minutes further south is Umegahama. You can see it on your left as you drive over the bridge, just before you hit Nichinan City. You can surf either side of the river. The surf at Umegahama has many peaks.\nThe last beach on the Nichinan stretch is Kojima. This place is more famous for its monkey residents, but it lights up when the typhoons strike from June to November.\nStandup paddleboards are not allowed on any of the Nichinan beaches. This rule is clearly signposted and strictly enforced. The Nichinan area is less touristy than other places, but if you are respectful, you'll be fine to enjoy the great waves on offer."}

It's about a 3.5 hours' drive from Fukuoka, and about a 1.5 hours' drive from Kagoshima.\n### Aoshima, the perfect blend of culture, sun, and fun\nMiyazaki is noted as the birthplace of Japan, which means it's steeped in history. Known for both its sunshine and ocean views, there's no better way to blend the two than to visit a seaside shrine.\nAoshima is perhaps Miyazaki City's most popular tourist attraction. You can easily spend an entire day at the island and in the surrounding village.\nAnd if you love surfing or want to learn, there are numerous surf schools and surfboard rental shops at Aoshima Beach.\n### Heiwadai, a peace park built from the memories of WWII\nJust a 10-minute drive north of the city, the sprawling Heiwadai Park is a fantastic place to relax, stroll, and learn about Japanese history.\nThe main feature of the park is the 37-meter-high Hakko Ichiu Monument, now the Peace Monument, which was constructed with stones from the time of the war-time Japanese empire.\nHakko Ichiu means “eight corners of the world under one roof,” which was a slogan used at the time it was built. You can climb up the steps and for a gorgeous view of the park and city.\nHeiwadai Park also has many replica clay soldiers lining the paths, known as Haniwa. They were excavated from the tomb of nearby Saitobaru Kofungun.\nThe lake in the park makes for a pleasant stroll, and with abundant lawns, you can easily have a picnic or take a relaxing nap under the sun.\n### Miyazaki Shrine, where spirituality and history blend\nMiyazaki Shrine is dedicated to Jimmu, the mythical first Emperor of Japan (711 B.C.-585 B.C.). There are three shrines inside the complex, as well as a tunnel of red shrine gates you can walk through. Also within the grounds is the Miyazaki Prefectural Museum of Nature and History.\nIn early April every year, Miyazaki Shrine has a demonstration of yabusame (horseback archery). Be sure to visit if you happen to be in the area.\n### Cycling along the Oyodo River\nThe Oyodo River is the main channel that runs through the city. From the city ward office, a dedicated bicycle path stretches along the river's length, making for a beautiful, scenic ride largely devoid of cars. Take your own bike or rent one at the Tourist Information Centre in Miyazaki Station or at the Giant Store Miyazaki on Tachibana-dori Nishi 4-chome.\n### Udo Jingu Shrine in a cave\nAbout 40 minutes from Miyazaki by car is Udo Jingu shrine. The shrine's main building is in a large cave, halfway down a cliff, open to the ocean. It is dedicated to Emperor Jinmu's father.\nNot only is the local area replete with a wide range of fulfilling attractions, but Miyazaki City is also a great place to base yourself as you venture up and down the coast to places like Nichinan and Hyuga."}

The drive takes about an hour. By train from Miyazaki Station, take the Nichinan Line toward Shibushi.\n### A shrine with great views and a cave with mystic powers\nUdo-jingu Shrine is perhaps Miyazaki's most spectacular seaside shrine. One of only a very few shrines built inside a cave in Japan, this shrine has amazing views of the water below.\nAs you leave the shrine, there is a large rock on the shore into which people throw stones for good luck. Make sure you buy some little stones and throw them into the hole below (men with their left hand, women with their right). If they go in, your wishes will come true. This is a lot harder than it sounds!\n### Replica Moai statues and sweeping ocean views\nSunmesse Nichinan, about a five minutes-drive north of Miyazaki, is a small theme park with seven huge replica Moai statues. Touching different statues brings different kinds of luck.\n### Take a step back in time in Obi Town\nObi Town is an old castle town that used to be home to some of Japan's most powerful figures when Miyazaki was a big player in Japan.\nThe old town would not look out of place in any samurai period drama, and is particularly atmospheric at night. Take a stroll along the cobblestoned streets to appreciate its beauty.\nMuch of the original castle still stands today, and some of the lost sections have been restored in recent years.\n### Surf some of Miyazaki's wildest waves\nThe stretch of coast along Nichinan Kaigan is wild and full of volcanic rock formations. That makes it popular with surfing enthusiasts. One of the most popular breaks is Umegahama, just on the left side of Route 220 as you head south into Nichinan City.\n### Encounter the cute horses at Cape Toi\nMisaki horses, a type of horse native to Japan, inhabit Cape Toi, near Kushima City. All 550 hectares of Cape Toi are home to horses, and if your timing is right, you may encounter them on the road. At the Cape Toi Exchange Center Pakarapaka, visitors can enjoy specially prepared food and drinks and purchase local products while enjoying the panoramic view from the cape."}

Unspoiled beaches and island getaways surrounded by crystal-clear seas that draw swimmers, divers, and sea kayakers, while the island of Tsushima attracts eco-tourists with its flora and fauna.\n## How to Get There\nIf you are traveling by air, Nagasaki Airport or nearby Fukuoka Airport are your best options. You can book bus tickets from either one that will take you directly to the city of Nagasaki.\nAlternatively, you can catch the bullet train all the way from Tokyo—or major cities between—to Hakata Station in Fukuoka. From here you have two options: catch a bus or ride the JR Kamome Limited Express to Nagasaki Station.\nIf you are traveling to Nagasaki from Fukuoka, you can catch a bus from Hakata or Tenjin, or ride the JR Kamome Limited Express from Hakata Station.

Nagasaki shippoku is a fusion of Japanese, Chinese and Western cuisine that often features meats such as fowl and other game. Some examples are kakuni (braised) pork and hikado, hashed meat and vegetable stew. (Photo: ©NPTA)\n- Ariake Blue Crab\nOnce plentiful throughout Japan, the Ariake blue crab has a large, diamond-shaped torso, and is found most often in Saga Prefecture.

Curling around the western point of Kyushu, its proximity to mainland Asia made it the place open for trade during Japan's long period of isolation. This vibrant port city of sloping hills is renowned for its color, charm, and international influence.\n### Don't Miss\n- Festive celebrations at the Nagasaki Lantern Festival\n- Dejima and Glover Garden, home to some of Japan's earliest foreign merchants\n- Panoramic views from Suwa Shrine\n- Paying your respects at the Nagasaki Peace Park\n## How to Get There\nNagasaki City is usually reached by air or land.\nFrom Nagasaki Airport, making your way into the city is very easy. Buses will transport you to Shinchi Bus Terminal in the city center.\nAlternatively, you can travel directly to Nagasaki from Fukuoka Airport by bus. Buses depart for Nagasaki every hour, with a one-way journey taking roughly 2.5 hours.\nFor holders of the JR Rail Pass, the sleek and futuristic-looking Kamome Limited Express running from Hakata in Fukuoka to Nagasaki Station is your best choice.\nNagasaki City itself is serviced by a charming tram network. Although not covered by the JR Rail Pass, a cost-effective 1-day pass is available.\n### Where Chinese culture illuminates\nStrong Chinese influence in Nagasaki is visible through a Chinatown, Confucian temples and local restaurants. For a further fascinating glimpse into Chinese culture in the city, the Kunchi Festival in early fall and Nagasaki Lantern Festival in late winter are must-see events. The festivals involve a spectacular riot of illuminated decorations and dragon dances.\n### Home to foreign traders\nIf European history is more your style, Nagasaki doesn't disappoint. Dejima is where Portuguese missionaries and Dutch merchants once resided and did business with Japan. The nearby Dejima Wharf overlooks Nagasaki's harbor, where international vessels still come and go.\nSimilarly, Glover Garden is an open-air museum displaying foreign residences and Western-style buildings constructed at the end of the 19th century. The view of the harbor from the Former Glover Residence is also a highlight.\n### A specially guarded shrine\nAlso offering outstanding harbor views is Suwa Shrine. Reaching the shrine is not for the faint-hearted, but well worth the trek. Visit during October 9 to see one of Nagasaki's most famous festivals, Nagasaki Kunchi.\n### The legacy of the atomic bomb\nThe dropping of the second atomic bomb on Nagasaki during World War II is commemorated in various memorials dedicated to the incident. The Nagasaki Peace Park is a stark reminder of the devastation caused by the atomic bombing. Don't be deterred from visiting, however, as these monuments and the Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum also deliver a message of peace, hope, and sheer resilience."}

Most famous are the Goto Islands, technically a chain of over 100 islands and part of Saikai National Park, but usually referring to the five most famous in the group.\n### Don't Miss\n- Kibinago, a silver-striped rounded herring, and Goto delicacy\n- Diving in the coral reefs of Rojojima\n- Osezaki Lighthouse, a favorite among tourists\n- Touring many of the islands' Catholic churches\n## How to Get There\nAccess the islands by air, ferry or jetfoil.\nThe island of Fukue has its own airport, with daily flights scheduled from Nagasaki and Fukuoka.\nFerries and jetfoils run to the islands from Nagasaki Ferry Terminal, with journeys ranging from 90 minutes to 3-4 hours. Note that the jetfoils tend to be canceled in inclement weather.\nFerries also run between the islands themselves. For travel on the islands, rental car is the most convenient due to infrequent public transport.\n### Go fish\nThe Goto Islands are famed for their azure waters and deliciously fresh seafood. A mecca for marine sports, indulge in whatever takes your fancy. With bathing, canoeing, and coral reef diving all popular pastimes, the islands are also host to many excellent fishing spots.\nFor the more sedate traveler, step onto the pristine sands of Takahama Beach on Fukue Island and you may not want to leave.\n### Spectacular sunsets await\nIf undulating waters don't tempt you, picture-perfect sunsets might.\nFacing the East China Sea, and also on Fukue, Osezaki Lighthouse sits atop precipitous cliffs. Whichever way you look stunning scenery greets you: rolling hills, turquoise seas and outstanding views that extend into the distance.\n### Island faith\nA safe haven for persecuted Christians in the 17th century, the islands are dotted with over 50 churches of all shapes and sizes boasting historical and architectural appeal. Some are awaiting UNESCO heritage status.\nConstructed after Japan's ban on Christianity was lifted, the churches are testament to the dedication of their followers.\nWhile the history of Japan's hidden Christianity is fascinating in itself, be sure to note the subtle nuances in church design and architecture.\n### Real-life inspired art\nIn 2013 the Goto Islands served as the backdrop for a comedic manga and anime, Barakamon. Following the story of a young man banished to the islands, the artwork is populated with local attractions and scenes from daily island life.\n### Further afield\nIf you really want to get away from it all, consider a journey to Iki and Tsushima, the most distant of the Nagasaki Islands.\nWhile Iki is known for its beaches and breathtaking coastlines, the mountainous Tsushima is a favorite with bird watchers, fishermen and hikers alike.\nBecause of its proximity to Korea, it's also possible to make a day trip from Tsushima to the Korean mainland and vice versa. On clear days, look out for the South Korean shoreline and try to see the buildings on its shores."}

From there, Hirado is about a 90 minute bus ride away.\nJR limited express trains run from Hakata Station in Fukuoka. This two-hour journey will set you back around 5,000 yen round trip. You can also get the hourly JR Seaside Liner trains from Nagasaki. A 100-minute journey for 1,680 yen one way. Nagasaki Airport and Sasebo are connected by airport buses (75 minutes, 1,400 yen one way).\n### Sasebo\nNow an internationally important city, Sasebo was once a humble fishing village controlled by the Hirado Domain until shortly after the Meiji period.\nIt was around this time that the Admiral of the Imperial Japanese Navy, Heihachiro Togo, surveyed Sasebo. Seeing the protected deep-water harbor, nearby coal mines, and its geographic proximity to China and Korea, he took the initiative. Sasebo Naval District was founded in 1889. This harbor came to play an important part as a major port for the Japanese navy during the First Sino-Japanese War and Russo-Japanese War. It remained a major navy base until the end of World War II.\nThe Sasebo we know today was founded on April 1, 1902. Although it was spared an atomic bomb, Sasebo suffered heavy damage during World War II.\nAfter the end of World War II, the United States Navy took over part of Sasebo base and formed the U.S. Fleet Activities Sasebo in 1946.\nBecause of the U.S military base, Sasebo allows visitors to experience various aspects of American culture. The most famous of these is Sasebo's acclaimed Sasebo Burger. Soft and sticky buns, and an abundance of lettuce and sauce—these together make the Sasebo burger delicious.\n### Hirado\nConnected to the mainland Nagasaki by a red bridge, Hirado is just a short drive from Sasebo. Hirado was once the port of call for ships between the Asian mainland and Japan as far back as the Nara Period (710-784).\nMost of this trade took place at the Hirado Dutch Trading Post, built in 1609, which you can still visit today.\nSimilarly to Sasebo, Hirado has also been influenced heavily by foreign visitors—primarily the Dutch. Hirado still retains its own style of Japanese culture, however, making it a unique and fascinating place to visit.\nIn addition to the Trading Post, try visiting Hirado Castle, once the home of the Matsura Clan. Offering gorgeous views of Hirado Port and the ancient forest of Kurokojima Island, the castle is the perfect place to look out over Hirado.\nIf it's culture you're after, Hirado has it in abundance. Rich with festivals famous across Japan, you should be able to take part in one regardless of what time of year you visit. Perhaps the most notable is the Tabira Jangara, a harvest dance where the dancers keep their faces hidden throughout the performance. Because of it's elegance and cultural importance, this dance has been listed as a National Intangible Cultural Property.\nFor nature lovers, the Kawachi-toge pass is a beautiful walk, offering a uniquely panoramic view of the island. On a clear day, you may even be able to spot Iki and Tsushima off into the distance. Kawachi-toge pass is perfect for a hike on a beautiful day.\nIn spring Hirado holds the Hirado Thousand Lantern Festival. Said to celebrate the renewal of spring, the festival is held over two days in April. Come see Fumonji Temple illuminated with stone and bamboo lanterns. Each bamboo lantern is hand carved by local artisans.\nThe city is alive, with food stalls lining the streets and live music. Come walk the winding cobbled path to the temple and enjoy this beautiful festival.\nIf you arrive early enough, you can get a prime view of Jigenzakura, a 140-year-old giant sakura tree—a sight not to miss."}

Rakan\nThe caves near Rakanji Temple are home to more than 3,700 stone figures of the Buddha, including 500 rakan, or disciples of Buddha. Stroll around the area for a serene and peaceful experience.\nAfter checking out the panoramic views of the surrounding peaks and valleys from the top of Rakanji, visit the nearby Aonodomon Tunnel, built by a monk who wanted a safer route to the temple through Kyushu mountains. According to legend, it took him 30 years to dig the tunnel by hand.\n### Visit Usa-jingu Shrine, the premier Hachimangu shrine\nHachiman shrines are the second most numerous in Japan after Inari shrines. Hachiman shrines enshrine the legendary Emperor Ojin, deified as Hachiman-shin, the god of warriors.\nUsa-jingu Shrine in the city of the same name was the first to enshrine this deity, making it the head of all Hachimangu shrines. The shrine has very close ties to the Imperial Family, especially since the Hachimangu shrine at Usa contributed very significantly in the building of the Great Buddha at Todaiji in Nara.\nThe expansive grounds cover about 150,000 square meters. Enter the shrine from the front to pass beautiful Hatsusawa Pond.\nThe contrast of Usa's white earthen walls, vermilion pillars, and accents of black and gold is striking.

The main hall is a National Treasure, and its seated wooden Buddha is one of Japan's Important Cultural Properties.\nThe peaceful forested surroundings and tranquil atmosphere make the temple an ideal place for relaxation and contemplation. Try an hour-long zazen seated meditation practice to tap into the temple's spiritual power.\n### A nostalgic 3D portrait of postwar Japan\nAlso in Bungotakada is Showa no Machi, a re-creation of a traditional Japanese town from the 1950s that is a popular spot for tourists and locals alike. Quaint shops with nostalgic signage sell electrical goods, snacks, toys and other items from the period.\nStroll the streets at your leisure or pick up a map of the neighborhood to uncover its hidden facets.

When Japan prohibited the religion in the 17th century, many believers were forced to renounce their faith to avoid execution, or practice their faith in secret.\n### Learn about the area's dark religious history\nThe Oita Christian Martyrs Memorial Park is a tribute to the 200 local people who died as Christian martyrs in the 17th century. The figures remembered here decided they'd rather face execution than denounce their faith.\n### Soak up art of local and national significance\nOita Prefectural Art Museum's 5,000 works include pieces designated Important Cultural Properties of Japan. Dive deep into the world of the local artistic talent, by visiting the Oita Prefectural Art Museum, a modern structure built in 2015 that houses work by artists inspired by the local way of life.\n### Family fun with sea life\nWhether you want to unwind while watching fish and other sea creatures or interacting with them in shallow pools, Oita Marine Palace Aquarium \"Umitamago\" offers something for everyone.\nThere are many performances and interactive sessions where you can watch dolphins, sea lions and other animals in action and find out more about their living environments.\n### Monkey and nature conservation in action\nOpened as a means to manage the local monkey population and their natural environment, Takasakiyama Natural Zoological Garden is a great way of seeing a typical day of the 1,000 wild monkeys.\nDon't miss feeding time, a daily highlight of the monkey garden.

The tea produced in Ureshino is smooth and light in taste, with a full body and good aroma.\n- Saga Beef\nSaga beef is relatively new to the scene, appearing in 1983, but has already established itself as a mouthwatering alternative to more famous brands such as Kobe and Matsusaka. From the Japanese wagyu breed, the meat is known for its glossy marbling and depth of flavor.\n- Karatsu Ware\nThe Japanese concept of wabi sabi, or imperfect beauty, runs through every facet of the culture, including 17th century Karatsu-yaki. Originally produced in Saga, not far from Nagasaki, Karatsu is a robust pottery that marries a rough beauty with hand-painted designs to create plates, vases, and tea ceremony bowls.\n- Imari Ware\nExquisitely decorated and delicately crafted, imari yaki fine china is named after the seaport town of Imari but made in Arita—the birthplace of Japanese porcelain painted with colored overglaze. Imari ware dates back to the 17th century, and is thin and light yet solid and durable.\n## Seasonal Highlights\n- Spring\nSpring in Saga brings out awe-inspiring cherry blossoms, carp streamers along the Kawakami Ravine, spring hiking in Mitsuse, and the Arita Ceramics Fair.\n- Summer\nTime for fireworks festivals at Kawakamikyo and Nouryou.

It is believed that getting close to the divine fire cleanses you, and purifies you of sins. Take a stroll through downtown Saga during the Saga Light Fantasy display. Feel the warmth of the Ureshino Hot Spring Matsuri."}

The two pottery towns are quaint, quiet and filled with narrow alleys, old buildings, and protruding chimneys from the pottery kilns.\n### Don't Miss\n- The hand-crafted ceramic work dotted across the area\n- Pick up a bargain at Japan's largest ceramic market\n- Arita Porcelain Park's European atmosphere\n## How to Get There\nBoth Arita and Imari are a short ride from Saga Station—a major stop on the JR line linking Fukuoka to Nagasaki.\nThe journey to Arita on the JR Sasebo Line from Saga Station takes roughly 40 minutes. Express trains from Hakata Station in Fukuoka take a little under 90 minutes. To get between Arita and Imari take the Matsuura Railway Nishi-Kyushu Line.\n### Quick Facts\nArita is considered the birthplace of Japanese porcelain\nArita porcelain was originally produced exclusively for Japan's elite\nHuge quantities of porcelain from Arita were exported to Europe\n### The home of Japanese porcelain\nA great deal of porcelain history has taken place in this area, so a recommended first stop for you is The Kyushu Ceramic Museum. Here you can learn about the origins of the region as well as ceramic production, and its evolution over time.\n### Visit the area's sacred past\nThe nearby Tozan-jinja Shrine—officially known as Sueyama-jinja—is unique in that many of its features that would normally be made from stone are made from porcelain instead. Since Tozan is situated on a hill, you are also rewarded with some spectacular views of the town and its lush, mountainous backdrop.\n### European grandeur in lavish grounds\nA trip to Arita Porcelain Park offers a drastic change of scenery, which might even make you forget you are in Japan. This park features a stunning garden and palace designed in the style of 18th-century German Baroque architecture. This is said to be a tribute to Arita's influence on European ceramic design.\n### Calling all pottery collectors\nEach year during Japan's Golden Week, which generally runs from April 29 to May 5, Arita hosts one of the largest ceramic fairs in Japan. Hundreds of vendors set up shop. It's an opportunity to obtain some very special pieces at affordable prices.\n### Ceramics galore\nGolden Week isn't the only time reserved for ceramic hunting. There's also the Arita Ceramics Home Plaza, which is open year-round and features over 20 stores offering a vast selection of quality ceramic items.\n### The historic Okawachiyama village\nAfter acquainting yourself with pottery culture in Arita, head over to Okawachiyama Village in Imari. Here you will find yourself in a secluded, historic setting within the mountains featuring kilns, pottery workshops, and stores. This small, densely populated pottery village is quite a contrast to the modern setting of the surrounding city.\n### The spirit of Japanese craftsmanship\nArita and Imari are most famous for their pottery; however, a trip to these locations also provides an intimate glimpse into the world of traditional Japanese craftsmanship. Many of the techniques have been passed down through generations, and are still being practiced today.\n### Going further\nYour visit to the pottery hubs of Arita and Imari will take the better part of a day, but if you have time to spare, be sure to head over to the quaint seaside of Imari City. Wander the history-filled streets and visit the famous Koimari Clock, which is also made from porcelain."}

The area has a variety of attractions on offer including beautiful beaches, caves, castles, and a fish market. If you are looking for a hassle-free trip with a variety of historical and natural sites to explore, Karatsu City is definitely for you.\n### Don't Miss\n- Explore natural history on a Nanatsugama Caves tour\n- Make an early morning stop by the Yobuko Fish Market\n- Relax on Nijininomatsubara Beach\n## How to Get There\nKaratsu is easy to access on the JR Chikuhi Line, which connects directly to Fukuoka.\nIf you're flying into the area via Fukuoka Airport, the best way to get to Karatsu is to catch the Kuko Line to Nishi-Karatsu from Hakata Station. From the nearby city of Saga, catch the JR Karatsu Line heading to Nishi-Karatsu.\n### Scale the castle top observatory\nThe centerpiece of the city is Karatsu Castle. A hilltop-style castle that you can climb or take an elevator. The castle is sometimes referred to as Maizuru, which means dancing crane, because the castle's top tower and lower roofs resemble a crane's head, body, and wings. The top floor is an observatory where you can enjoy a spectacular 360-degree view of the city, Karatsu Bay and the Ariake Sea.\n### Early morning fish market\nIf you enjoy dining on seafood, visit the Yobuko Fish Market, which is famous for its sashimi-style squid. It's also known as the Morning Yobuko Fish Market, because it's common for visitors to arrive here early to get their hands on the freshest fish straight off the boat.\n### Journey caves by boat\nAmong all the boats near the Yobuko Fish Market, there's a small cruise boat that will take you into the Nanatsugama Limestone Caves. There are seven caves in total that have been formed by the crashing waves. Sit back and relax as you enjoy geological wonders—each designated a natural monument of Japan. Above the caves is a plateau offering some alternate views.\n### Take some time to celebrate\nIf you happen to be in the area around the first few days of November, don't miss the famous Karatsu Kunchi Festival, which draws crowds by the thousands. Witness the lavishly decorated hikiyama floats that come in many forms from ferocious dragons to giant sea creatures. During the rest of the year, the elaborately decorated floats are on display in the festival museum.\n### Stunning waterfalls\nHead over to rural Ouchi Town, just south of Karastu where you can explore Mikaeri Falls. Mikaeri has been listed within Japan's top 100 waterfalls and features a hydrangea festival from the second weekend in June until late July.\n### Finish off the day with a beach sunset\nKaratsu is home to some of Japan's most beautiful coastline, which is definitely worth exploring when you're in the area. Nearby is the Nijinomatsubara Forest, which stretches out around five kilometers and is comprised of over a million Japanese black pine trees. It can be explored on foot, by bike, or car.\n### Exploring deeper\nIf you still have time for some historical exploration, there's the Hizen Nagoya Castle ruins, located around 10km north of Karatsu City. This was once a wartime castle strategically built during the infamous 16th-century invasion of Korea by the warlord, Toyotomi Hideyoshi. While it's primarily a park, there are still visible remnants of Japan's tumultuous warring states era."}

It is packed with its own charms both obvious and obscure. Saga City is more urban than the smaller, rural towns close by, so there is plenty of dining and nightlife compared to other places in the prefecture. You can also get in touch with nature, enjoy some leisure activities, and visit various historical locations.\n### Don't Miss\n- The scenic and accessible Saga Castle\n- Saga's well-established art museums\n- Spectacular nights views at the Saga City Observation Deck\n## How to Get There\nSaga is easily accessible by either train or plane. There's a direct flight from Haneda Airport to Saga that will get you there in under two hours.\nIf traveling by train, Saga Station is easily accessible from Hakata Station, which is located near Fukuoka Airport.

The castle itself was first constructed in the 16th century; however, it has been rebuilt and renovated several times. The last reconstruction was of the Saga Castle History Museum in 2001, resulting in the largest wooden reconstruction in Japan.\n### Get a bird's-eye view of the city\nA 10-minute walk from the Saga Castle History Museum will take you to the Saga City Observation Deck which is free, and open until 10 p.m. The deck is located on the top floor of the Saga Prefectural Government Office with an outdoor elevator off to the side of the building for public use. It's particularly stunning at night when you can get a 360-degree view of the illuminated cityscape.\n### Explore contrasting shrines\nPay a visit to the Saga-jinja and Matsubara-jinja shrines—they are located very close to each other. Saga-jinja Shrine has a commanding presence with two large cannons positioned out front signifying Saga's role in the development of advanced weaponry. In contrast, Matsubara-jinja Shrine is more serene with its koi-filled creeks, old trees, and vibrant colors.\n### Book of the samurai\nFor those interested in samurai history, the famous book of quotes and inspiration, \"Hagakure,\" originated in Saga. The author, Yamamoto Tsunetomo, was a samurai of the Saga Domain, which he cites often throughout the book's passages.\n### The world famous balloon festival\nIf you happen to be in Saga around early November, you'll have the opportunity to visit the internationally famous Saga Balloon Fiesta, which is held annually along the Kasegawa River.

The key to Saga is exploration and a healthy dose of curiosity.\n### Outside the City\nAfter a day of exploring Saga City it's time to check out the surrounding areas. Takeo Onsen and Ureshino Onsen are famous for their hot springs. Arita and Imari are essential stops for aficionados of pottery or traditional artistry.\n### Visit nearby Karatsu\nKaratsu features castles, fish markets, cave exploration and pleasant beaches to keep you occupied.

This ancient form of Shinto music and dance has been passed down for centuries by the people who live and work in the town to offer thanks to the local guardian gods and a good harvest.\nEvery year from the end of April to the beginning of May, Miyako holds a festival (often called \"Shinkosai\") accompanied by kagura offerings to pray for the peace of the community and a good harvest. The kagura performed during the festival is unique to the area. It is a joyous occasion for festival-goers to participate in and connect with the ancient traditions of the area.\n### Don't Miss\n- Energetic performances by masked dancers\n- Heartfelt music played with traditional Japanese instruments (flute, drums and copper clappers)\n- The colorful traditional costumes\n## How to Get There\nThe town of Miyako, host of the main festivities, is best accessed by car. From Kitakyushu, the drive should take around 45 minutes.\n### Kagura Basics\nKagura is a dance based on Japanese mythology, translated as \"entertaining the gods.\" Originally called \"kamukura\" or \"kamikura,\" kagura dances are thought to have been very simple, similar to miko (shrine maiden) dances or puppet dances. Kagura is performed in many other parts of Japan.\nKagura evolved over time into its present form, becoming grandiose and theatrical under the influence of noh and kabuki. After the Meiji period (1868–1912), local people, rather than priests, began dancing in kagura performances, and it became known as sato-kagura, or \"village kagura.\"\nKagura in Miyako is characterized by its re-enactment of Japanese mythology, especially the story of \"Amano-Iwato\"—the re-enactment of various stories in the myth to the sounds of traditional Japanese flute music and taiko drums.\nThe dancers are usually dressed in colorful, archaic costumes and masks, sometimes performing at a high level. In some programs, priests play the roles of mythical gods.\n### Preservation and transferral of kagura's cultural heritage\nKagura has long been a primary form of entertainment, serving as a ritual for local communities. The people of the Keichiku region, including in Miyako, consider kagura to be a source of pride for their community. They have worked diligently to preserve and pass on their traditions. Thanks to these efforts, the region has become one of the best places in Japan to see and learn about kagura. The people of this region see it as a central part of their heritage and have become the most dedicated practitioners of kagura in Japan.\nThere are five groups in Miyako and more than 30 groups in the Keichiku area that actively perform kagura. Each has the community's support and carries out its own unique traditions while making efforts to pass them on to the next generation.\nIn March 2016, the form of kagura handed down in the Buzen area (the old name for the Keichiku region, which includes Miyako) was recognized as an Important Intangible Folk Cultural Property of Japan.\n### Festivals in Miyako and the Keichiku area dedicated to kagura\nFrom late April to early May each year, kagura is performed at shrines and other venues throughout Miyako. During this time, each kagura troupe in Miyako performs an outdoor ceremony at the town's local Ubusuna Shrine.\nTraditional festivals in which kagura is performed as an offering are held only in the town of Miyako. At other times, such as during the Kagura Festival, visitors can see it as an event rather than a Shinto ritual at venues in neighboring Buzen or other locations in Fukuoka Prefecture. The dedication of traditional kagura, passed down from generation to generation, begins from around 7:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. on the day of the festival in Miyako, continuing until midnight. In the past, the festival was held until dawn, when the Iwato \"rock door\" would open to light up the surrounding area, just like the mythological \"Amano-Iwato.\"\nAnyone is welcome to watch kagura. If you do watch, please be mindful of the sacredness of this tradition and be respectful of the local community.\n## Keywords"}

It has been designated as one of the Historic Monuments of Ancient Nara by the UNESCO World Heritage Convention along with other culturally and historically significant items throughout the city.\n### Don't Miss\n- Witness the Great Buddha statue, created by the combined efforts of 2.6 million people\n- Browse the world's largest Great Buddha Hall that enshrines the Great Buddha statue\n- Climb the stairs to the Nigatsu-do Hall and capture fantastic views of the Nara basin\n## How to Get There\nIf traveling from Osaka or Kyoto, take JR or Kintetsu Nara lines and get off at either JR Nara Station or Kintetsu Nara Station. It takes 40 minutes from Osaka, and 50 minutes from Kyoto respectively.\nTodaiji Temple is just a 20-minute walk from Kintetsu Nara Station. If traveling by city bus, it is a 5-minute walk from Todaiji Daibutsu-den/Kasuga-taisha-mae stops. Alternatively, board at Kintetsu Nara Station and get off at Daibutsuden-mae-chushajo stop if traveling via the loop bus (Omiya Street Route or Nara Park Route).\n### Quick Facts\nThe Great Buddha statue was created in the year 752\nThe Daibutsu-den that surrounds it was constructed in 1709\nThe Great Buddha is 14.98 meters tall. Even its ears are 2.54 meters in length\n### Todaiji Temple and its numerous national treasure buildings\nWishing for happiness for all, it took a total of roughly 2.6 million people to come together and create the Great Buddha statue that now sits in Todaiji Temple's Daibutsu-den, the Great Buddha hall. The statue itself is referred to as the “Daibutsu” in Japanese, with “dai” meaning giant and “butsu” meaning Buddha, however it is modeled after the Vairocana Buddha.\nAside from the Great Buddha, Todaiji Temple is home to numerous national treasures and cultural assets, and so the temple itself was registered as a Historic Monument of Ancient Nara by the UNESCO World Heritage Convention in 1998.\nPhoto: Nara Visitors Bureau\n### Among the world's largest wooden buildings\nAlongside the Great Buddha statue, the Daibutsu-den hall was also designated a national treasure. A tremendously large wooden building, it suffered terribly to two great fires before being rebuilt again in 1709. It was originally 88 meters in length, but was scaled down to in the process of rebuilding due to financial difficulties and now stands at 57 meters. Despite this, it still stands as the largest wooden structures in the world.\nPhoto: Nara Visitors Bureau\n### Commanding views of Nara city\nNigatsu-do hall can be found east of the Daibutsu-den hall of Todaiji Temple, and was constructed during the eighth century (although it needed to be rebuilt in 1669). It sits somewhat distanced from the hustle and bustle of the city, and while the stairs to the top are a little steep, but the views of Nara city that can be seen from the balcony are a great reward. It is a beautiful location to pause and take a short break, especially as the lanterns and the city lights begin to glow as the sun begins to set.\nAside from the views, Nigatsu-do is also known for hosting the “Shuni-e (Omizutori Festival)” in March to pray for the well-being of the people. The “ Omizutori” ritual is held before dawn on March 13, where the sacred water is transported from the well beneath the Nigatsu-do hall in offering to the goddess Kannon.\nLarge torches are lit in the evening in order to guide the monks as they move, creating a fantastic spectacle of fire and water.\nPhoto: Nara Visitors Bureau / Eisuke Ueda\n### Other World Heritage Sites in Nara with long histories\nThere are many deer in Nara Park next to Todaiji Temple. Visitors will have no trouble spotting them while strolling through the center of town, especially if traveling between the other UNESCO World Heritage Sites, a small distance from Todaiji Temple. Be it on foot or by short bus ride, other notable sites well worth a visit include Kofukuji Temple, Yakushiji Temple, Toshodaiji Temple, and Kasuga Taisha Shrine.\n## Keywords"}

It's a long way from big city life and well worth the trip.\n### Don't Miss\n- Stroll along Ginzan River and the town's pedestrianized streets in your yukata\n- Visit Shirogane Park and cool yourself by its waterfalls\n- Stay overnight and dine at one of Ginzan Onsen's many hot spring inns\n- Take an outdoor rotenburo bath or enjoy a private kashikiri soak\n## How to Get There\nGinzan Onsen can be accessed by a combination of JR trains and buses.\nFrom Tokyo, take the JR Yamagata Shinkansen to Oishida Station (three hours, 20 minutes), then catch a bus to Ginzan Onsen (35 minutes). The train is covered by the Japan Rail Pass, but the bus is not. Be aware that buses only depart Oishida Station every 60-90 minutes.\nVisitors traveling by car are required to park at a designated parking area outside the town center. Many inns offer a shuttle service into town from the lot.\n### Get to know the onsen-kyo\nPopular among Japanese travelers, the term onsen-kyo is associated with small, quaint towns and cozy inns that offer accommodation, food and hot spring bathing. As weekend retreats, they are popular with all age groups, from young families to retirees. This cherished aspect of travel in Japan often goes unnoticed by foreign visitors, so live like a local and dive into onsen-kyo culture.\nThe area is a car-free town center with no modern buildings in sight.\nHaving checked into one of the town's many inns, visitors walk the streets without the usual concern of cars zipping past to beat the traffic light.\nIn the proud tradition of Japanese inns, Ginzan Onsen's ryokan offer up sumptuous local dishes to meet the standards of their mostly Japanese clientele.\n### Such stuff as dreams are made of\nBeautiful buildings surrounded by an unspoiled rural setting ensure that Ginzan Onsen is pleasant all year round. Long summer days are perfect for lazy strolls down idyllic streets in a yukata. In winter, the town really works its magic. The sight of the buildings blanketed in snow and illuminated by the soft glow of gaslights leaves a lasting impression.\nMany Japanese visitors come to Ginzan Onsen in search of its Taisho period ambience. Anyone familiar with Mishima Yukio's novel 'Spring Snow' will delight at how the setting blends traditional Japanese aesthetics with what was once seen as modern sophistication. The gaslights and absence of motor vehicles help maintain the atmosphere.\n### The finer points of hot spring bathing\nRotenburo are outdoor baths-usually hidden from outside view-which allow you to take in the surrounding scenery from the comfort of a hot spring. Another attractive option is arranging a kashikiri session in a private bath, whereby you and traveling companions can have a tub all to yourselves for a short time.\n### Silver everything\nUnsurprisingly for a town founded on a silver mine, Ginzan Onsen takes both its name (literally, Silver Mountain) and iconography from the element. The popular Shirogane Park boasts an impressive 22 meter tall waterfall, and you'll also find an illuminated cave which is well-lit and ideal for taking pictures.\n### Old meets new meets old\nGinzan Onsen's one notable concession to modernity is the Fujiya ryokan, a striking building designed by famed architect Kuma Kengo. With a blend of modern and traditional elements, including the incorporation of bare timber and white plaster, it stands out from its surroundings while also keeping one foot firmly in the past.\n## Keywords"}

The time required from Osaka is shorter; 3.5 hours by plane and car, or 10.5 hours by train.\nIf you are coming by plane, you can fly from Tokyo's Haneda Airport or Osaka's Kansai International Airport to Miyazaki Airport. From there, it is a 2-hour drive to Cape Toi.\nIf you are going by train, take the Tokaido/Sanyo Shinkansen to Kokura Station. It takes about 4.5 hours from Tokyo Station, or 2.5 hours from Shin-Osaka Station. From Kokura Station, take the JR Nippo Line to Miyazaki Station (5 hours). From Miyazaki Station, change to the JR Nichinan Line to Kushima Station (another 3 hours), and drive about 30 minutes from Kushima Station to Cape Toi.\n### See indigenous wild horses grazing freely\nCape Toi presents a singular sight to visitors—rugged volcanic coastal views in the background and wild, nationally protected horses in the foreground, with the vivid blue of the sky paired with the lush green grass of the hills.\nYou're free to get close to the horses for pictures, and they often come close to you as they seldom show any fear of humans. However, refrain from touching or feeding them.\n### Panoramic views from the lighthouse\nThe Cape Toi Lighthouse is an impressive landmark. Not only does it act as a warning beacon for ocean vessels, but it also offers you quite remarkable views along the vast, rocky coastline and deep into the open sea.\n### Learn about Cape Toi's history at the Cape Toi Tourist Exchange Center Pakalapaka\nMiyazaki has a significant place in the history of Japan. It used to be a samurai stronghold, and legend has it that the horses of Cape Toi were left abandoned by their samurai masters some 300 years ago. You can learn more about this story at the Cape Toi Tourist Exchange Center Pakalapaka.\n### See a mountain shrine engulfed by jungle trees\nMisaki-jinja Shrine was built on the mountain face of Cape Toi in the year 708. The shrine is surrounded by thousands of cycad trees, and the red of the shrine makes for a striking contrast with the green of the trees.\nYou can reach the foot of the mountain but due to recent mudslides, access to Misaki Shrine itself is prohibited.\nBuilt and used by holy men in isolation lends the shrine a mysterious air. One of Miyazaki's most spectacular seaside shrines, it ranks with Aoshima-jinja Shrine and Udo-jinja Shrine for the views.\n## Keywords"}

It's a small beach town where tradition meets modern life in a relaxed environment of clear ocean water, sandy beach and palm trees.\n### Don't Miss\n- Sunrise at Aoshima Shrine\n- Surfing in front of swaying palm trees\n- Yoga on the beach\n## How to Get There\nAoshima is well connected and can be reached by car, bus or train. Car is best if you're bringing your own surfboards.\nAoshima is about 20 minutes' drive south of Miyazaki City. Head south on Route 220 and follow it until the Aoshima turn-off on your left just after you cross the bridge over the Kaeda River (about 2 minutes after the baseball stadium). The closest train station is Aoshima Station on the JR Nichinan Line.\n### Sunrise at the Aoshima Shrine\nNestled in and amongst a tropical forest on the small island of Aoshima and accessible by bridge, Aoshima Shrine is the main attraction in the area. Make sure you get there for amazing sunrise pictures of the big red torii gate.\nThe island is a micro-climate, which means that the island is home to over 500 endemic species that can only be found on the island and in a few nearby areas in Kyushu. While most of the forest is fenced off from visitors, it can be explored via a series of paths leading off from the interior of the shrine. It is also well worth taking the path that circumnavigates the island to see the spectacular rock formations known locally as the \"Devil's Washboard.\"\n### A surfer's paradise\nSurfing is one of the main draws of Aoshima, and it has some of the most consistent waves in all of Japan. There are currently more than six surf schools and places to rent boards, most located along the beachfront. Most staff speak basic English, and they'll have you up on your board within the day. Coaching, wetsuits, boards, and accessories are all included in coaching packages, but can also be rented separately.\n### Surfside yoga\nThe yoga scene has recently exploded in Aoshima. Whether you like hot yoga, slow yoga, yoga with exercise balls or yoga on the beach, you will find it in Aoshima. You can pay for single sessions or get discount vouchers at most yoga studios.\nCafe Zeal up in the mountains and Surf City in central Aoshima are two popular places for yoga. Cafe Zeal has excellent vegetarian food while Surf City offers surf/yoga packages.\n### Chill out at Aoshima Beach Park\nOne of the best additions to Aoshima in the last few years has been Aoshima Beach Park.\nThe park is located right on the beach just in front of Aoshima Shrine. With music and beach food, it's the perfect place to sit back with a cool drink after you've had a surf or yoga session.\n### Sample the local cafes\nIf you're ready to drag yourself away from the water's edge and search for sustenance, there are several cool little cafes that sell local food and excellent, hearty-post surf fare.\nOne is Monaural, near Aoshima Station, known for its hazelnut lattes.\nIf you want the best burgers in town, stop by Good Days on Route 220, just on the left as you come down the hill past the baseball stadium. It's not on the island, but it's only a 5-minute drive away.\n### Savor the seafood\nAoshima is originally a fishing village, so the seafood is one of the area's main attractions. There are several excellent sushi and sashimi restaurants in the area.\nAcross the road from the ANA Hotel is Amimoto, a restaurant that's known for its kaisendon seafood bowl. Aoshimaya, located at the beginning of the arcade that leads to Aoshima Shrine, is another recommended restaurant for seafood.\n## Keywords"}

While there have been breaks in the past, the festival is said to have originated in 1179 during the Heian period, and has continued for more than 800 years.\n## How to Get There\nThe festival takes place close to Tenjin Station, which is on the subway from Hakata Station.\nDontaku events are held across Fukuoka City, but the main parade runs from Gofuku-machi Station to Tenjin Central Park. A smaller parade takes place just outside Hakata Station. Recently, there have been events around the Hakata Port area.\n### Don't Miss\n- Jumping in to dance along—be an active participant\n- The decorated floats called hana jidosha, meaning flower bus\n### A golden celebration\nHakata Dontaku is held on May 3 and 4 every year during the busy holiday period of Golden Week. Through the course of the festival, tens of thousands of revelers dressed in bright, traditional costumes dance through the streets of Fukuoka. Over the two days of processions, an estimated two million people cheer on the participants.\n### Call of the housewife\nThe festival features groups of extravagantly costumed dancers, who parade through the streets clapping shamoji. This tradition is said to have originated from a housewife who was preparing dinner, and joined in by tapping the shamoji (rice scooper) in her hand.\n### A 12th-century festival\nHakata Dontaku dates back to 1179 when, in its earliest iteration, it was known as Matsubayashi, a festival to celebrate the Chinese New Year and honor the area's feudal lord. In the Edo period (1603-1867), the festival evolved into a parade known as Torimon. This parade was led by people dressed as gods.\n### The history of Dontaku, and a change of name\nAlthough the Meiji era (1868-1912) government banned the parade because of its extravagance, the citizens of Hakata maintained the festival by changing the name of the parade to Dontaku. The word Dontaku is derived from the Dutch word for Sunday, \"Zontag.\" The Dutch were the only foreign nation permitted to trade with Japan, from Nagasaki, during the Edo period.\n### Colorful flower busses\nBesides the dancers, the festival features decorated floats called hana jidosha. These flower buses were originally just decorated with brightly colored fresh flowers, but have evolved to use electronic displays. Throughout the festival period, the six hana jidosha cruise through the streets of Fukuoka, and are brilliantly lit up at night.\n### A two-day festival\nThe festival is two days. On May 3, the Matsubayashi Parade is held early in the morning, reenacting the original parade that took place in 1179. The parade is led by three gods of fortune riding on horseback and a group of dancing children.\nThe Dontaku parades are held in the afternoon on both May 3 and 4. These last all afternoon, and incorporate dancers, marching bands and the hana jidosha. In total, there are around 750 groups of performers, comprised of groups from across Fukuoka and Kyushu. More recently, international groups have also been invited to take part.\n### Stage performances\nAs well as the parades, around 30 stage areas are set up across the city that each host a wide variety of performances, along with food, drink, and game stalls. Watch for Hakata Niwaka. The masks of these comedians were said to originally used to hide the identities of those satirizing the government in open street performances.\nClosing out the two-day festival are rousing renditions of the Dontaku dance that the festival's spectators are invited to participate in.

The train takes about 30 minutes.\n### Dazaifu Tenmangu Shrine\nDazaifu's most famous shrine is dedicated to Tenjin, the deified form of the 9th-century poet-scholar Michizane Sugawara. Originally tied to natural disasters and the plague, Tenjin came to be regarded as a god of education. Students still pour into Dazaifu Tenmangu around exam time to pray for success.\nThe street leading to the shrine is lined with shops selling umegae mochi, a local specialty of fried mochi rice cakes filled with sweet red-bean jam. Ice cream stands sell only-in-Japan flavors like green tea and black sesame, and there are numerous shops selling souvenirs and knick-knacks.\n### A sea of Sugawara's favorite blooms\nThe shrine and its grounds are magnificent any time of year, but they really come alive in early March when over 6,000 plum trees burst into bloom.

The town is surrounded by mountains and sea, and offers seasonal treats such as spring cherry blossoms, summer fireworks, and winter snow. Check Kinosaki Onsen's official website “Visit Kinosaki” for more details.\n### Don't Miss\n- Visiting the seven public bathhouses\n- Strolling in a yukata\n- Making a side trip to Onsenji Temple and the nearby mountain\n## How to Get There\nKinosaki Onsen Station is the gateway to the town, connected by the San'in Main Line to Kyoto and Osaka.\nIt takes about 2.5 hours from Kyoto or Osaka to Kinosaki Onsen Station by direct express train.\n### A riverside town\nOn either side of the Otani River are numerous Japanese inns, or ryokan, most of which have their own onsen baths.\n©Toyooka City\nThe seven public baths dotted around the town are one of the unique characteristics of Kinosaki. Visitors to the area can buy a one-day pass for 1,300 yen (as of November 2021) that allows bathing in all seven. Additionally, hot bubbling foot baths can be found in numerous locations. If you are staying at one of the town's ryokan, all of the public onsen can be accessed for free from when you check in until you check out.\n©Toyooka City\n### Slip on a yukata and stroll about town\nIt is not uncommon to see visitors to the area walking around the town in yukata—the thin cotton kimono that are closely associated with Japanese onsen towns. During the colder winter months, a warm, cotton haori jacket is worn on top of the yukata to keep out the cold.\n### The town's mysterious origins\nTowards the western end of Kinosaki Onsen is Onsenji Temple, which is dedicated to the Buddhist priest who supposedly founded Kinosaki Onsen in the 8th century. Legend has it that a priest named Douchi Shonin arrived in Kinosaki in the year 717, where he saw people suffering from incurable diseases. When he prayed for help, a white-haired man appeared to him in a dream, and suggested that he could find a hot spring. The priest believed the oracle, and chanted sutras for 1,000 days, after which hot water gushed from the ground, leading to the creation of the hot spring town.\n©Toyooka City\nOnce upon a time, visitors had to pray at the temple before they were allowed to enter the baths. While this is no longer the custom, the temple is still a great place to visit and can be combined with an enjoyable stroll through the mountains at Kinosaki's western edge.\nThe main hall of the temple can either be accessed by a short walk up the mountain or by taking the ropeway, which can take you to an observation deck at the top of the mountain.\n©Toyooka City\n### The Oriental White Stork Sanctuary\nDue to loss of habitat, the Oriental stork became extinct in Japan in 1971. The last bird actually died in Kinosaki Onsen's Toyooka City. Konotori no Sato Park was built as a research institute to protect and breed the storks, which are a National Natural Monument, and to reintroduce them to the wild. At the adjacent Stork Culture Museum, visitors can learn about efforts to reintroduce the storks, and see those used for breeding up close. The park is about 10 kilometers south of Kinosaki Onsen, and can be reached via bus from Toyooka Station.\n### Winter snow\nThe area around Kinosaki Onsen is great for activities and includes the Kannabe Kogen area. Here, visitors can enjoy climbing and hiking in summer or skiing, snowboarding and snowshoeing during winter. The town of Kinosaki receives regular snowfall and is very pretty during this season, as the river area is lined with fresh snow.\n## Keywords"}

Roughly 300 species of wild birds are regular visitors here, so take all your camera gear to get some memorable snaps of Steller's sea eagles and Japanese red-crowned cranes.\n### Relaxing waters and mountain views\nHead inland and away from the choppy waters of the Nemuro Strait to get the best views of the glorious Shiretoko mountain range stretching out into the distance. Try Kaiyoudai Observatory in Nakashibetsu or Tawadaira Observatory in Shibecha for the best views.\nEnd your day with a hot soak and delicious dinner at secluded Yoroushi Onsen.\n### Rich and delicious fish\nIt's no wonder that so many bears, whales, dolphins, and birds thrive on and around the Shiretoko Peninsula. The waters are replenished annually by rich nutrients deposited by the drift ice, meaning you get to try some of the best local seafood in Japan.\nAs a starter, try some uni (sea urchin) and hokke (Atka mackerel) in Utoro and Rausu; follow up with some ikura (salmon roe), shrimp and scallop in Odaito; and there's always room for some Hanasaki crab from Nemuro and its famous sanma (Pacific saury).\n## Keywords"}

Hiko英彦山\nTagawa-gun, Fukuoka-ken\n## Challenging hike into spirituality where shrines and temples coexist\nMt. Hiko is one of Kyushu's most enjoyable scenic hikes, with a history that intertwines with the Shugendo sect of Buddhism. Just over an hour's drive from Fukuoka City, Mt. Hiko is one of the best opportunities to challenge your legs. The longest hike is 17 kilometers and takes five to seven hours.\n### Don't Miss\n- The autumn leaves: Mt. Hiko is a great hike year-round but truly comes to life during autumn, when the changing leaves transform the landscape\n- The shrines: Mt. Hiko was the center of training for the Shugendo sect of Buddhism, and the mountain is notable for its collection of temples and shrines\n## How to Get There\nMt. Hiko is most easily accessed by car, though it can be reached via public transport.\nThe Hitahikosan Line connects Hikosan Station and Kokura Station, but due to heavy rain part of the line is closed and passengers are required to take a bus from Soeda Station. The ride takes a little under two hours and requires at least two changes. Local buses run from Hikosan Station to Hikosan Bessho at the base of the mountain.\n### High peaks\nThe hiking route around the mountain starts at Hikosan Bessho, from which you ascend an ancient stone staircase to reach Hohei-den, a shrine and an Important Cultural Property built in the year 1616. From Hohei-den, you can take the stone staircase directly to the top, or follow that path around the mountain and over the mountain's three major peaks.\nThe highest of these peaks is Minami-dake, at 1,199 meters. The views from the top are excellent, and during autumn, the colors of the turning leaves are simply stunning; vivid hues of red, gold and purple add brilliance to the hike's panoramic viewpoints.\n### Shrines of grandeur\nMt. Hiko was the center of training for the Shugendo sect of Buddhism, known for its ascetic mountain training, and the mountain is notable for its collection of temples and shrines. Hohei-den, the largest of these and formerly a lecture hall, is the most majestic and can be enjoyed for its history and magnificent wood-shingle roof. More restrained in size but still impressive is Tamaya-jinja, which sits at the base of a cliff. Meanwhile, Daiminami-jinja is built in a cleft beneath an overhanging cliff.\nJogu-jinja Shrine sits atop Naka-dake, the mountain's middle peak, and is linked with the Hikosan-jinja, which is located at the bottom of the mountain. The final shrine on the main route is Takasumi-jinja, which is home to a bronze bull that hikers stroke for luck: the horns and nose are more polished than the rest of the body.\n### Trees as old as time\nThe forests of Mt. Hiko are ancient, and much of the forest has escaped the commercial cedar plantations that are found across Japan. One noteworthy tree is Onisugi, a huge cedar tree estimated to be around 1,200 years old.\n### On the way\nIn Soeda-machi, at the base of Mt. Hiko, is the Hikosan-jingu Hohei-den. It is said to have been first built in 740 and was home to Shugen-do Buddhists. The current structure dates from 1616. The Hohei-den is also the starting point for the Hikosan Jingu Shrine Gojinkosai Festival held every April.\n## Keywords"}

In addition to chicken, grilled skewers of beef and pork can also be enjoyed. The scent of fresh-grilled skewers wafts through the city, and is sure to work up an appetite.\nIn the Jojima area sake brewing has long flourished, thanks to an abundance of water and high-quality rice. Kurume boasts one of the largest number of sake breweries in Japan, and offers a wide variety of sake.\n## Keywords"}

Its setting and aspect gave two prominent directors, Akira Kurosawa and George Lucas, the inspiration for major films.\nThe castle and the town built around it are packed with history, and small enough to walk around in a day.\n### Don't Miss:\n- The small shrines and memorials on the grounds of Akizuki Castle\n- Akizuki's central avenue, lined with blooming cherry trees in the spring\n- Taking a half-day hike up Mt. Kosho\n## How to Get There\nAkizuki Castle is near Fukuoka and accessible by train, bus or car.\nAkizuki Castle is a 45-minute drive from the city of Fukuoka.

Take the bus from Amagi Station.\n### A charming town with a deep history\nThe town of Akizuki and its castle are overflowing with history. The earliest iteration of the castle was built in 1203 and inhabited until the beginning of the Meiji era in 1873. All that remains of the castle are the stone walls and reconstructed sections of the original gatehouses, including the impressive Kuromon, or Black Gate.\nThe town has several important shrines and temples. Akizuki Hachimangu, up the hill to the south of the castle in the middle of a forest, was used by samurai for pre-battle preparations and religious ceremonies. To the north of the castle is Dairyoji Temple, site of the graves of many samurai and noble families who lived in the area.\n### Cherry blossoms on Sugi-no-Baba\nMuch of the city is centered around the castle and the main boulevard leading to it, Sugi-no-Baba. On this street you'll find the Akizuki Museum, several teahouses including the excellent Kuromonchaya, and the ruins of Akizuki Castle.\nSugi-no-Baba also has one of the most marvelous displays of cherry blossoms in Fukuoka Prefecture. The entire street is lined with cherry trees that grace the street with pale pink and white blossoms in spring. Replacing the cedars that once grew there, the cherry trees were planted to honor Japan's victory in the Russo-Japanese War.\n### A hidden fortress on a mountaintop\nA three-hour hike takes you from central Akizuki to the top of Mt. Kosho and the ruins of Akizuki Fortress, the inspiration for the 1958 Kurosawa film The Hidden Fortress. The Hidden Fortress also plays an important role in modern pop culture as one of George Lucas' main inspirations when writing the script of the first Star Wars film.\n### History brought to life\nAt the entrance to the town is Megane-bashi, or \"spectacle bridge,\" which was designed and built by the same stonemasons who crafted the bridge of the same name in Nagasaki. This is the starting point for the town's annual samurai procession, which takes place in late October each year.\n### Consider some culinary options\nThe town offers some excellent cuisine and wine. Set back in the forest is Seiryuan Ryokan, an inn with a charming outdoor onsen and excellent traditional Japanese multi-course dinner. And the soba shop at the base of Mt. Kosho is so popular locally that it has become difficult to get a seat, and quickly sells out of noodles.\n## Keywords"}

From there, it's about a 25-minute, albeit scenic, hike to Mikaeri Falls.\n### Flowing waters and purple rain\nWhile beautiful in all seasons, the area leading to Mikaeri Falls is particularly scenic in June, when hundreds of hydrangeas burst into bloom. Heralding the arrival of the rainy season, violet flowers line the waterfall trail, and the Hydrangea Festival draws thousands each year.\n## Keywords"}

Men in traditional costume race through the streets of Hakata with yamakasa—elaborately decorated one-ton floats. If you are here in mid-July, grab a seat and enjoy this festival steeped in history and its vibrant atmosphere.\n### Don't Miss\n- Make sure to grab a great spot for watching the festival\n- Aside from the big day, smaller events run for two weeks prior to the race\n- Keep your eyes peeled for the different colored headbands of the participants\n## How to Get There\nThe festival takes place throughout the Hakata area of Fukuoka, which can be reached by shinkansen from major cities throughout Japan. The subway is the best way to get around in Fukuoka, and there are also local buses and trains.\n### Two million visitors\nThe Hakata Gion Yamakasa is one of Japan's most exciting festivals. Teams of men race the yamakasa, which are vibrantly decorated one-ton floats. Almost two million spectators gather to watch this classic annual festival, which is centered around Kushida-jinja Shrine.\n### The floats\nThe yamakasa floats used in the festival come in two categories. Colorful decorative floats are called kazariyamakasa, while the floats that are raced in the festival are known as kakiyamakasa. The kazariyamakasa floats are displayed around Fukuoka City from July 1.\nEach float is more than 10 meters tall and decorated with lifelike figurines of samurai or popular anime characters. The floats are made by their teams with the expertise of master Hakata doll makers. The float exhibited at Kushida-jinja Shrine can be viewed all year round.\n### Where to watch\nThe festival is concentrated around the Kushida-jinja Shrine, but the race course covers much of the Hakata area. The intersection of Higashimachi-suji and Meiji-dori offers a great spot to watch the floats and their teams approaching from a distance. Meanwhile, the intersection of Showa-dori Street and Taihaku-dori Street allows each float to be seen twice as they race down the parallel streets.\n### The start\nFrom July 10, a series of events takes place in which the kakiyamakasa racing floats are carried across the city. The festival culminates with the main race event, called Oiyama, on July 15.\nAt 4:59 a.m., drums signal the start of the race, and the first float sets off along a five-kilometer course. It takes the fastest teams around thirty minutes to complete the course and teams are judged on both speed and style—teams are required to look graceful and heroic as they run with the floats on their shoulders.\n### The teams\nSeven teams compete in the race, each one representing the historic districts of Hakata: Higashi, Nakasu, Nishi, Chiyo, Ebisu, Doi, and Daikoku. Each team spends several months in the lead-up to the festival preparing their float and practicing for the race.\nColored headbands, known as tenugui, distinguish the different roles of the participants. Red designates runners whose responsibility is to carry the float; red and white designates elders responsible for planning and logistics; lastly, blue and white designates elders responsible for the health and safety of the entire operation.\n### The strategy\nAround 30 runners carry the float at any one time, while others run in front of the float, at the back, or along the sides. Two dai-agari ride atop the float (one facing forward, the other facing backward) and direct the runners.\nUsing a red baton known as a teppou the dai-agari point out individual runners who should swap with fresh runners. The weight of the float imparts such a toll on the carriers that even the strongest runners do not usually last longer than three or four minutes, before swapping with a better-rested runner.\n### The history\nThe history of the festival can be traced back almost 800 years to a Buddhist priest named Shoichi Kokushi. At that time, an epidemic spread across the city and Kokushi. Keen to prevent the spread of the disease, he was carried on a platform around the town praying and sprinkling holy water. This religious ceremony was held annually by the people of Hakata to prevent the disease from returning and gradually evolved into the Yamakasa festival we see today.\n### The course\nThe course of the main race starts next to Kushida-jinja Shrine and finishes behind the Fukuoka Asian Art Museum. The route winds through the streets of Hakata, and the corners become the focal point for the racing action, as the heavy floats are swung with a great groan around the sharp corners.\nSpectators throw water at the participants to keep them cool as they run the course. The floats are staggered and leave Kushida-jinja Shrine every five minutes, and the racing ends shortly after 6 a.m.\n### A curious tradition\nParticipants and many residents of Hakata refrain from eating cucumber over the festive period as the cross-section of a cucumber resembles the emblem of the festival's deity, Gion-sama, who is enshrined at Kushida-jinja Shrine.\nPhotograph(s) provided by Fukuoka City\n## Keywords"}

The collection includes the silken hanging scroll of three Buddhas called “Shaka Sanzon” and a painting of Mt. Fuji by renowned Edo-period painter Ogata Korin (1658-1716).

They set up a guard post at the village entrance to strictly control the kiln. Here, highly skilled potters produced high-quality Nabeshima-yaki as custom ordered offerings without concerning themselves about profitability.\n### Potters with samurai status\nThe Nabeshima clan paid the potters who worked at Okawachiyama and allowed them to use their family names, just like the samurai. Although the artisans were taken care of by the clan, their work was managed by a government office with strict rules in place, including restrictions on entering and exiting the village. A pyramid-shaped monument and 880 unmarked graves is dedicated to the Korean potters and other craftsmen who worked here.\n### A walk through Okawachiyama\nAt Okawachiyama, visitors can learn about the history of Nabeshima ware, which is considered to be at the pinnacle of modern pottery in Japan.

If you have a car, parking is available on site.\nOita Station is served by the JR Kyudai, Hohi and Nippo Main Lines, offering access to much of the wider Kyushu area.\n### The history\nIn the 16th century, during the rule of the war lord (daimyo) Sorin Otomo, Christian beliefs and culture flourished in modern-day Oita and many people became ardent believers.\nHowever, with the prohibition of Christianity in the early 17th century, thousands of believers were arrested and executed for refusing to denounce their Christian beliefs. This memorial park was established to remember some 200 local people who died as martyrs to Christianity.\n### The introduction of Christianity\nOtomo was one of the war lords at that time to have converted to Roman Catholicism. He engaged in trade with the Portuguese ships that landed in modern-day Oita and the city became a major point of contact between Japan and the west.\n### The arrival of Saint Francis\nSorin met Saint Francis Xavier, a Jesuit missionary and one of the first Europeans to arrive in Japan. Saint Francis' arrival in Japan in 1549 sparked the country's first real foray into the world of Christianity, Saint Francis spent over two years in Japan preaching the word of Christianity.\n### The purge\nFollowing the prohibition of Christianity in the 17th century suspected believers were forced to trample on holy images to prove they were not Christians. Others became ‘hidden Christians,' practicing their religion in secret to escape persecution or by blending it with Japan's religions of Shintoism and Buddhism.\n### The martyrs of Oita\nStill others refused to give up Christianity, even when faced with death. In modern-day Oita, too, there were many martyrs. In the village of Katsuragi, where this Memorial Park is located, some 200 martyrs of all ages defiantly chose to die rather than denounce their religious beliefs.\n### Watch the sun set across the park\nVisit the park to explore the story behind this period of religious conflict and pay tribute to the unwavering faith of the martyrs of Oita. Signposted with memorial monuments, the park is awash with a powerful feeling of serenity and peace during the evening sunset.\n## Keywords"}

The ravine is a great spot for hiking.\n### Quick Facts\nShiratani Unsuikyo Ravine was an inspiration for the famous anime film Princess Mononoke\nSome hiking trails here date back to the Edo period\n## How to Get There\nYou can get to Yakushima via high-speed boat, car ferry, and air.\nHigh-speed ferries run from Kagoshima or Ibusuki to the island, as do planes from Kagoshima, Osaka, and Fukuoka. A car ferry runs between Kagoshima and the island as well.\nLocated a short drive south of Miyanoura Port on Yakushima, Shiratani Unsuikyo Ravine can be accessed by bus or car.\nThe ravine is 30 minutes from Miyanoura Port by car. Public transport is available in the form of infrequent buses from the port. The journey takes 35 minutes. One bus leaves every two to three hours. The ravine is a 2-minute walk from the parking lot.\n### The inspiration for Princess Mononoke\nThe forests of Shiratani Unsuikyo are incredibly atmospheric. The ancient trees and moss-covered stones in the park were used by Kazuo Oga, the lead artist of Princess Mononoke, as inspiration for the film. It is worth watching the movie before going to see just how closely the artwork resembles the forests here.\n### Choose your path\nThe ravine has a network of well-maintained hiking trails. The shortest takes about an hour to walk, but some trails take up to five hours to complete.\nThe condition of the trails varies greatly, from old logging tracks to more recently developed paved paths. Navigating the ravine is easy as English and Japanese signs are provided throughout. You can get a trail map at the entrance to the trails.\n### A rocky vantage point\nIt is worth following the trail to a large rocky outcrop called Taiko Iwa. This outcrop is in the center of the island and offers panoramic views across Yakushima's interior mountains.\nThe trail is best for those with a reasonable level of fitness. There are several steep sections on the way to the top.\n### The largest cedar among giants\nAt the far end of the park is a trail to Tsuji Toge Pass that will take you to the fabled Jomon Sugi, Yakushima's largest cedar, estimated to be anywhere between 2,000 and 7,000 years old. The trip there takes five to six hours one way.\n## Keywords"}

It is thought the tree is anywhere between 2,000 and 7,200 years old.\n### Quick Facts\nYakushima is a UNESCO World Heritage site\nAccess to the tree is restricted to an observation deck set 15 meters away\nThe hike to the tree takes around 10 hours—expect to leave before dawn to return by sunset\n## How to Get There\nJomon Sugi is accessible via the Shiratani Unsuikyo Ravine and the Arakawa Trail (starting at the Arakawa trailhead).\nThe Arakawa Trail is a 30-minute bus ride from the town of Anbo.\nFrom March to November, private cars are not allowed on the access road to the trailhead, so a shuttle bus from Yakusugi Museum is your best way to access the area.\n### Pre-historic forests\nJomon Sugi's name is a reference to the Jomon period (c. 8000 B.C.-300 B.C.) of Japanese prehistory. The tree is 25.3 meters high and a circumference of 16.4 meters. Dendrochronology conducted by Japanese scientists on the tree's branches indicated that Jomon Sugi is at least 2,000 years old, though other predictions put the tree's age closer to 7,000 years.\n### The importance of Jomon Sugi\nThe tree was officially discovered in 1966, and its importance sparked efforts to protect the forests of Yakushima, a move which ultimately led to the island's designation as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1993.\n### Reach the observation deck to get the view of Jomon Sugi\nAfter Yakushima's World Heritage designation, access to the tree was restricted to an observation deck built 15 meters from the base of the tree. The platform is designed to prevent damage to the roots of the Jomon Sugi in response to the increased number of visitors following Yakushima's UNESCO World Heritage Site status.\n### The other famous trees\nAlong the trail to Jomon Sugi, there are several other famous trees. These include Meoto Sugi, a pair of trees that resemble a husband and wife embracing; Daio Sugi (Great King Cedar) one of the largest trees on the island; and Wilson's Stump (named after the English botanist Ernest Henry Wilson), the remains of a giant cedar that was felled in the 1580s. Wilson's photographs of the stump, which date to the early 20th century, were recently discovered in the Harvard University archives.\n## Keywords"}

Takachiho and married a local princess, thus becoming a mortal. This ancient shrine was constructed around the sixth century in his honor.\nThe shrine was originally located at the foot of the sacred Mt. Takachiho, but after being repeatedly burned down by volcanic eruptions, it was moved to its current location. The shrine, which was rebuilt in 1715, is a National Treasure.\n### Ancient roots, spiritual energy\nAn 800-year-old cedar tree next to the main shrine building is testament to the roots of this spiritual spot, and you can almost feel the ancient energy in the air. Make sure to walk behind the ornately decorated main building to the lesser-visited shrines for a more personal encounter with the mountain god.\nIf you're feeling adventurous, a visit to the shrine's original location at Takachihogawara, which is also the start of the Kirishima hiking trail, is recommended. On the tenth of each month, a Shinto ceremony is held by priests from Kirishima-jingu Shrine, and the desolate location is reminiscent of a scene from an Akira Kurosawa movie.\n## Keywords"}

Set aside a day to leisurely explore the gardens, on-site attractions, and excellent dining options.\n### Don't Miss\n- Stunning Japanese gardens built in 1658\n- Spectacular views of the active Sakurajima volcano\n- An eclectic mix of cultures at the old residence in the center of the gardens\nSakurajima as seen from Sengan-en\n## How to Get There\nSengan-en is located on the coast just north of Kagoshima City and can be easily combined with other nearby attractions.\nSengan-en can be reached from Kagoshima Chuo station in 30 minutes via the Kagoshima City View Bus, or the Machi Meguri Bus. There are also regular buses operating from Kagoshima station.\n### Beautiful gardens, borrowed scenery\nBuilt in 1658 as one of the residences of the Shimazu clan that ruled over this area, the garden's most striking feature is the active Sakurajima volcano and Kagoshima Bay that are framed in the background.\nSakurajima snow-covered in winter\nThe gardens cover over 12 acres and include serene ponds, gently bubbling streams, mysterious shrines, traditional tea rooms, a bamboo grove, and a mountain hiking trail. A walk to the top of the trail takes about 30 minutes one way, but it is certainly worth it for the breathtaking view from the top.\nStop in at the chic Matcha Cafe tearoom after exploring the grounds\n### Follow in the footsteps of a feudal lord\nThe house at the center of the garden is a fascinating mix of Japanese, Chinese and Western influences, showing the international tastes of the Shimazu clan.\nHiding the nails that join the beams and pillars together, decorative kugi-kakushi in the shape of bats adorn the hallways. Bats were a lucky symbol in China because the Chinese word for bat sounds like the word for good luck.\nThere are twelve different types of these kinds of decorations around the residence, showing the playful attention to detail that went into building this magnificent dwelling.\nThe gate and inner gardens of the residence\nWalking through the winding corridors and spacious tatami rooms give you a real sense of how a feudal lord would have lived.\nThe chandeliers and western dinner service in the main reception room hark back to an era when Japan was beginning to open itself to the world in the 19th century. Indeed the house was visited by royalty such as Nicholas II of Russia, and Edward VIII of the UK, a testament to the influence of the Shimazu family.\n### Kagoshima delicacies\nBe sure not to miss out on some of Kagoshima's local cuisine served up at Sengan-en's flagship restaurant Ohkatei. Some highlights include locally caught sea bream and kurobuta pork. It's easy to imagine how a feudal lord felt looking over the bay at Sakurajima while enjoying sumptuous local delicacies.\nFor those looking for a lighter snack, there is the famous local sweet treat known as jambo-mochi, two lightly toasted rice cakes skewered on two sticks and glazed with sweet soy or miso sauce. The two sticks are said to represent the two swords traditionally carried by the samurai.\n### Industrial heritage\nJapan was the only country in Asia in the 1800s to participate in the industrial revolution, and you can learn about it at the Shoko Shuseikan Museum just outside Sengan-en.\nFollow the course of the Shimazu family over 800 years and see how the international relations they forged led to the development of industrialization in modern Japan. The museum is housed in Japan's oldest remaining factory, built in 1865.\nThe Shoko Shuseikan Museum\n### Traditional craftsmanship\nColorful Satsuma Kiriko cut glass was first created in Kagoshima during the Edo period, at the time of the Shuseikan modernization project. Satsuma Kiriko is made by layering thick colored glass over transparent glass and then cutting patterns into the thick layer of colored glass to reveal the transparent glass below.\nThe entire process is done entirely by hand, and the skilled craftsmen can be seen at work at the Shimazu Satsuma Kiriko Glassworks next to Sengan-en.\n### World Heritage Site\nThe Shoko Shuseikan Museum and Sengan-en were recognized as a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Site related to Japan's Meiji Industrial Revolution in 2015. Both sites provide a wonderful opportunity to see a unique combination of beautiful Edo period gardens nicely contrasted with the modernization of the Meiji period and beyond.\n## Keywords"}

Dressing in a yukata and having hot sand shoveled over you up to the neck is a singular experience said to purify the body.\nNot far off Ibusuki's coast is an islet called Chiringashima. Linked by a sandbar to the mainland briefly during the day, and only between October and March, it is said to be a matchmaking spot.

The sand is naturally heated by an underground hot spring.\n### A singular spa experience\nAfter changing into a cotton yukata, go down to the sand bath area and you will be led to your spot by the kind staff. As soon as you lie down in the sand pit you can feel the warmth, but that's just the beginning. The staff will cover you up to the neck in a layer of the sand.\nThe sand reaches temperatures of around 50-55°C, and sweating is a given, but that accelerates your body's ability to rid itself of toxins. Around 10 to 15 minutes is enough time for the full effect, although some stay under longer. This treatment opens the pores, improves circulation, and increases blood oxygen levels. Afterward, head inside to the regular hot spring baths to rinse off the sand and soak in the cleansing and equally beneficial onsen waters.\n### Add a little infinity to your perspective\nVisit Healthy Land Tamatebako Onsen for a dip in an outdoor bath with incredible views of Mt. Kaimon. The gender-separate open-air infinity-pool style baths both feature views of the ocean and the mountain slopes.\n### Discover the city's ceramic history\nThe Satsuma Denshokan Museum, set on the grounds of Hotel Ibusuki Hakusuikan, was specifically designed to showcase the history of Satsuma (modern-day Kagoshima). The museum focuses on local ceramics mainly crafted during the early Meiji period (1868-1912).\n### A sleepy rural onsen town\nA trip to nearby Unagi Onsen, a real local onsen town, is a worthwhile excursion. Unagi Onsen is a laidback little village dotted with many small family-run hot springs. Rebel and last samurai Saigo Takamori loved this little town, and the chilled countryside atmosphere is a perfect backdrop for ultimate relaxation.\n## Keywords"}

With its imposing black exterior and steep ramparts, the castle was particularly difficult to break into and was designed specifically to discourage enemies from attacking.\n### Don't Miss\n- The festivals at the castle\n- Cherry blossom viewing around the castle grounds during spring\n## How to Get There\nKumamoto Castle is located conveniently in the center of Kumamoto City.\nFor this reason, you can walk or take a tram to the castle depending on where you are. There is a 170-yen tram ride from JR Kumamoto Station available that will get you to the castle in about 17 minutes; get off at Kumamotojo-mae tram stop. You can also take a scenic walk from Kumamoto Station to the castle in about 30 to 45 minutes.\n©Kumamoto Castle General Office\n### Ancient roots\nIn 1467, the Ideta clan laid the first foundations of the castle, which changed hands regularly up until 1632, when the Hosokawa clan took charge–less than 30 years after the actual castle had been completed. The Hosokawa reign lasted more than 200 years and spanned eleven generations. In 1871, the feudal system was abolished in Japan, and the castle was subsequently given to the Japanese government and has been in government hands ever since.\n©Kumamoto Castle General Office\n### Rise and fall\nEach ruler of the castle left their own mark on it with alterations and improvements being made many times over the years. The castle was heavily damaged during the Satsuma Rebellion of 1877, and significant reconstructions took place in 1960. A decade's worth of restorations finished in 2008, but an even bigger project is now underway, repairing the damage from the 2016 Kumamoto Earthquake.\n©Kumamoto Castle General Office\n### Down, but not out\nThe castle was one of the worst hit public buildings during the 2016 earthquake disaster. Almost a third of the castle walls were damaged, with 10 percent of them collapsing completely, throwing huge boulders down onto surrounding roads and grassy banks.\n### Piece of the puzzle\nThe restoration is estimated to take twenty years to complete. Each of the boulders of the castle walls is to be painstakingly arranged back into the correct order so the castle can be rebuilt exactly as it originally stood using traditional building methods. Like an intricate puzzle, the castle will be slowly slotted back together. Until then, limited parts of the castle are open to the public.\n### A popular attraction\nDespite the damage, the castle still draws many visitors who crowd around the perimeter to see the building. Certain parts of the castle have been opened for special events, but it will still be many years until the majority of the grounds are open to the public again.\n©Kumamoto Castle General Office\n### Castle events\nThe castle is known as the symbol of the city, and for this reason, there have been many fund-raising efforts to get the castle up and running again. Many events involving the castle are still being held. The Kumamoto Castle Autumn Festival and Spring Festival are held there, with many popular activities such as taiko drumming performances held next to the castle.\n## Keywords"}

Around thirty onsen ryokan can be found in this mountain town and provide a quintessential way to experience Japanese culture. Here you can indulge in nature appreciation, onsen bathing, multi-course kaiseki banquet dining, and cozy tatami-floor rooms.\nKurokawa Onsen is best enjoyed by checking into one of the inns, slipping into a light cotton yukata robe, and walking the streets in old-fashioned geta sandals.\n### Don't Miss\n- Going to different baths in yukata\n- Exploring the town's quiet cafes and shops\n- Enjoying locally made souvenirs\n## How to Get There\nKurokawa Onsen is not on any rail lines, but you can reach it via a direct highway bus from the city of Fukuoka.\nDirect buses leave from both Fukuoka Airport and Hakata Station, the latter of which is accessible by bullet train from Osaka and Tokyo. If you're leaving from Kumamoto Station, Aso Station is the nearest local stop to Kurokawa Onsen, but from there you'll still need to get a taxi or bus.\nArriving by car is handy, but be cautious on the small, winding roads and note that inn parking is limited and mostly reserved for overnight guests. Please use public parking if you are visiting as a day guest.\n### A retro townscape\nThis idyllic town, nestled in a valley surrounded by verdant, mist-covered hills, is a gorgeous place for a stroll even if you don't fancy taking a dip. Unlike some other resort towns in Japan, Kurokawa Onsen's simple, traditional atmosphere has been well preserved and feels a world apart from the crowded, flashy streets of Japan's major cities.\nBesides its inns and hot springs, the area offers beautiful mountain hikes and scenic drives, with English language maps available in Kurokawa Onsen's information center. If the weather is good, a few hours of hiking will reward you with some spectacular views of the mountainous scenery, after which you can soothe your tired body in one (or more) of the baths.\n### Elaborately designed onsen\nThe first thing you should do on arrival is get the Nyuto Tegata onsen-hopping pass. For 1,300 yen (700 yen for children) you can visit up to three different participating bathhouses. Purchase your pass from the information center and grab a handy English language pamphlet while you're there. Please feel free to inquire about recommendations as well.\nKurokawa Onsen has 28 hot springs, and most are within walking distance of the information center's car park. There are cave hot springs and hot springs where you can see waterfalls, among others. If you want to avoid the crowds, try an onsen on the outskirts of the town, such as Hozantei, which has a natural rustic setting and stunning riverside views, or Yamamizuki, a spacious riverside onsen.\n### Healing properties\nKurokawa Onsen's therapeutic baths have been popular for more than 300 years, and their naturally mineral-rich spring waters are believed to have healing properties. Different baths have different mineral compositions, and each is said to have different health benefits.\nWater from the geothermally heated springs is adjusted to make it comfortable for bathers. Most onsen have cooler pools or outdoor baths which help to improve circulation.\nTake a break and enjoy the abundant hot springs and tours around town. Though it's tempting to spend a long time in the bath, most people find they don't need much longer than an hour at any one onsen. It is recommended to use the drinking water available in the changing rooms so you can stay hydrated.\n### Onsen etiquette\nWhile there are some mixed baths, you'll most commonly find separate baths for men and women, as everyone is bathing naked. No swimsuits, clothing or jewelry are permitted in the hot springs, and you must adhere to strict rules such as washing thoroughly before entering the public water and tying up your hair if it has a chance of touching the water.\nPlease note that guests with tattoos are often not permitted to use public hot springs unless the tattoos are first covered, but check with the information center or the inn you wish to stay at beforehand. We also recommend trying a private bath, which can be rented.\n### Time for yourself in a private space\nKurokawa Onsen is most famous for the gorgeous scenery of its outdoor baths, but if bathing naked in front of strangers isn't for you, there is the option of renting a private bath. Costing around 1,000 to 2,000 yen per hour, you can enjoy the waters in solitude in a small, private bath. However, these baths are very popular and you may have to wait, particularly on weekends and during holidays.\n### Pick up some local produce\nIn between baths, there are plenty of shops and restaurants in Kurokawa Onsen to explore. The town offers multiple chances for souvenir shopping; you can buy snow shoes or bath salts to recreate the onsen feeling at home, or purchase other locally made gifts such as handmade pottery, printed fabrics, senbei crackers, and sake.\nKurokawa offers a bar-hopping pass that lets you try a variety of sake and shochu (sake's stronger cousin) at three different places across town. Finish your day of relaxation with an evening of delicious locally brewed beverages before heading back to your comfortable tatami room. At the end of your stay, you can leave your leftover bathing tokens at the local shrine or take them home with you as a souvenir.\n### When to visit\nNeedless to say, Kurokawa Onsen is packed during peak seasons, particularly the New Year's, Silver Week and Golden Week holiday periods. While it's good to avoid the rush, certain times of year are famously beautiful in Japan, such as cherry blossom season in spring, or the changing of the autumn leaves. Particularly good times to visit are autumn, for the temperate climate, and winter, for the chilly weather.\n## Keywords"}

Entry into hells individually is also possible for 400 yen per visit.\n### Wild things and sites of beauty\nOniyama Jigoku is an animal preserve better known as \"alligator hell.\" There are around 80 alligators here. Note that the jigoku are for viewing, not for bathing in, since they can reach temperatures of about 99 degrees Celsius. Four of them (Umi Jigoku, Chinoike Jigoku, Tatsumaki Jigoku and Shiraiike Jigoku) are designated as National Places of Scenic Beauty.\n### A unique way to cook\nLiterally meaning hell-steaming, jigoku mushi is a traditional way of cooking using the steam of a hot spring. It dates back to the Edo period (1603-1867) and is a healthy way to prepare food while also enhancing its dramatic flavor.\nSome hells sell specialty soft-boiled eggs and baked pudding, which have been steamed using the heat from the fiery hot springs.\n### Seven hell highlights\nThe largest of the hells is Umi (Sea) Jigoku, so named because of its cobalt blue color. It is 200 meters deep. The boiling clay of Chinoike (blood lake) Jigoku is blood red; this is the oldest of Japan's hells.\n### Rent your own hell oven\nIn Furomoto, you can buy a set of vegetables, meat or fish produce and cook the ingredients using a special steaming oven. Rental of the oven is extra. Be careful as the steam can escape with force when you open the steaming pots after cooking.\n## Keywords"}

The closest one, Ekimae-koto Onsen, is a two-minute walk from the station, while the furthest one, Shibaseki Onsen, is about a 30-minute bus ride.\n### Soaked in history\nAccording to legend, the hot spring water in the area was first used by the gods Sukunabikona and Okuninushi in the 8th century. The pair visited Iyo-no-Kuni, which is now known as Ehime Prefecture. While visiting the area, Sukunabikona fainted from illness. To cure him, Okuninushi piped water from Beppu Onsen to the ancient Dogo Onsen, which miraculously cured Sukunabikona.\n### The bath of samurai\nLater, in the Kamakura Period (1185-1333), wounded samurai bathed in Beppu Onsen to help speed recovery. Today, locals and tourists alike journey to the area to soak, for relaxation of the body and mind.\n### The perfect water for all types\nHot spring water varieties range from those high in chloride to those high in sodium bicarbonate. Many of the baths are claimed to be beneficial for illnesses like neuralgia, rheumatism, and fatigue. You can also try drinking the spring water at some hot springs (please check with staff beforehand), which is said to help gastroenteritis, diabetes, and gout.\n### Record-breaking onsen hub\nThere are close to 3,000 hot spring sources in Beppu City, representing more than 10% of all vents in Japan. Beppu City boasts the largest volume of hot spring water in Japan.\n### Onsen highlights\nBe sure to visit Ekimae-koto Onsen, the closest hot spring resort to Beppu Station. A bath shrouded in nostalgia, this onsen and ryokan looks like a classic European villa from the outside.\n### Step back in time\nWhen in the area you have to visit Hamawaki Onsen, the origin point of the Beppu Onsen district. Surrounded by rustic buildings and friendly locals, this laid back pocket of Beppu feels like time has stopped.\n### Getting dirty\nThe famous mud bath and the milky baths are on offer for those adventurous types wanting to get a little more out of their onsen experience.

In the 1910s, Unzen Onsen was further developed as a summer resort due to an influx of non-Japanese visitors. Since then it has grown in popularity with international and Japanese visitors alike.\n### A dark history\nAnother big pull of the area are the Unzen Hells. Here, hot springs gush out, fumaroles shizzle and erupt, and the smell of sulfur wafts in the air. You can see boiling hot springs at more than 30 hells.\nNamed for their hell-like appearance, these hot spring fields were once a place of torture. From 1627 to 1631, many Christian martyrs met their deaths here because of their religious beliefs.\nLook out for the monument erected out of respect for the martyrs.\n### Beauty is more than skin deep\nDespite Unzen Onsen's unique sulfur smell, Unzen spring water has marvelous qualities. Containing antibacterial properties, this water is said to be good for beautifying skin.\nOther beneficial properties include easing back and muscle pain as well as helping with fatigue, diabetes, and a number of other ailments.\n### Footbath square\nShould your time at Unzen Onsen be limited, consider a visit to the free Unzen Foot Onsen.

Given the nickname for its battleship-like silhouette, the eerie island and its former coal mine are one of Japan's most unlikely tourist attractions.\n### Don't Miss\n- Up-close and personal tours of an abandoned coal mine\n- Viewing Gunkanjima from the mainland\n## How to Get There\nTo reach Gunkanjima, you must join one of the organized tours that run several times a day. The tours leave from different locations in Nagasaki Port and vary in foreign language availability, age, health restrictions and other options.\nJourneys take roughly 30 minutes one-way. Tours may be canceled during times of severe weather or other unfavorable conditions. Advance reservations are highly recommended for weekends and during holidays.\n### Quick Facts\nGunkanjima is known as an uninhabited island of ruins\nThe island is a mere 480 meters long and 160 meters wide\nGunkanjima once boasted a hospital, two schools, shops and even a temple and shrine\n### A symbol of industrial development\nA reverse rags-to-riches tale of Japan's modernization in the years leading up to the second world war, Gunkanjima offers a truly unique glimpse into Japan's history. Developed by Mitsubishi and a hub of national coal mining, Gunkanjima's population reached an astonishing 5,300 people (approximately) in its heyday. Yet the island was quickly abandoned in around 1974 when energy needs changed, and the coal mines were closed.\nFor years the island was left to the elements, a grim symbol of Japan's rapid industrialization.\n### Dawning of a new era\nOpening to tourists in 2009, Gunkanjima spawned an interest in abandoned ruins tourism and was later named a UNESCO world heritage site in 2015. Observing the weather-beaten relics and decaying, dilapidated buildings up close, it's hard to imagine this island was once home to a thriving and vibrant community.\nShould you decide not to take a tour of the island, you can view Gunkanjima from Nagasaki's most southern tip when skies are clear. Peer closely, and you may even see the deserted buildings and watch the light filter through the crumbling windows.\n### Things to bear in mind\nYou cannot visit Gunkanjima alone. Due to the structural instability of the island, it is mandatory that all visitors travel in tour groups.\nTours may be canceled due to bad weather. It is best not to plan a trip during typhoon season, rainy season or during the winter months.\nYou may be denied access due to health issues.\nSome tours are not wheelchair accessible. Check with individual tour operators for specific terms and conditions.\nYou must sign a safety contract to participate in the tours.\n## Keywords"}

Yanagawa now offers slow, scenic cruises down the waterways in flatboats known as donkobune, poled along by boatmen in traditional wear.\nWhile you're in Yanagawa, tour the former home of Yanagawa's dominant clan, the Tachibanas, who ruled during the country's feudal era. Also be sure to sample its signature food, unagi—locally caught eel that's got a rich taste and plenty of protein. Unagi is especially good during the hot summer months.\n### Don't Miss\n- Cruises around the city's willow tree-lined canals\n- Festivals like the Ohina-sama Water Parade in early spring\n- Eating some of Yanagawa's famous steamed eel\n## How to Get There\nCar is the best way to get to Yanagawa, although public transportation is available.\nYanagawa is located in the southern part of Fukuoka Prefecture. From Fukuoka, take the train from Nishitetsu Fukuoka Station to Nishitetsu-Yanagawa Station, which takes about 50 minutes. If traveling by car from Fukuoka, take the Kyushu Expressway to the Miyama Yanagawa Interchange. It's 20 minutes from there to Yanagawa.\n### Yanagawa's historic canal cruises\nYanagawa's canals were fortified when Yanagawa was transformed into a castle town shortly before the start of the Edo period at the beginning of the 17th century. Now they are relaxing waterways you can explore on a cruise. Oarsmen with long poles push the narrow boats through the canals, telling you about the city's long and impressive history and singing nursery rhymes penned by Yanagawa's famous poet, Hakushu Kitahara.\nMany of Yanagawa's festivals, including the aforementioned Hakushu Festival and the Ohina-sama Water Parade, center around the canals and the boats that ply them. You can arrange for a ride on one of these boats online—search for Yanagawa punting. You can even get discount tickets.\n### Visiting the home of Yanagawa's dominant clan\nThe Ohana residence was built in 1738 as the home of the Tachibana clan, the feudal lords who ruled Yanagawa. The residence covers 23,000 square meters and is surrounded on three sides by canals. The residence's main feature, its garden, was built in 1910 by the 14th Yanagawa lord, Tomoharu Tachibana.\nThe garden features a lake surrounded by black pines. Overlooking the lake is the residence's grand banquet hall, a large Japanese room with tatami flooring. Other buildings include the impressive Western-style Seiyokan and a museum with displays of the time of the Tachibana family.\nA three-minute walk from Ohana is Suitengu, a beautiful riverside shrine, which hosts a small festival from May 3 to 5 with traditional dancing and singing.\n### Honoring one of Yanagawa's most talented creatives\nYanagawa is the birthplace of the Meiji-era (1868-1912) poet and children's songwriter Kitahara Hakushu (1886-1942). A three-day festival is held every November here to celebrate Hakushu's life, complete with poetry readings, fireworks, music and evening boat rides. The house where Hakushu was born has been transformed into a museum to celebrate his achievements.\n### Celebrate springtime in Yanagawa\nThe months of March and April are great times to visit Yanagawa. The city hosts a number of spring festivals, most notably the Yanagawa Hinamatsuri Sagemon Tour, or Doll Festival, held every year from February 11. During this festival, dolls are put on display in homes and businesses all over town.\nThe dolls are dressed in the style of the Heian era from the 8th to 12th century, creating a scene that evokes Japan's historic past. Some residents open up their homes to visitors so they can see these ornate dolls.\n### A fresh and unusual local delicacy\nUnagi, freshwater eel, is one of Yanagawa's specialties and prepared in a special way—marinated and steamed over rice served in a lacquerware dish, topped with a sweet sauce.

Less than an hour out of the center of the city, this sunny peninsula has sandy beaches, a busy surf scene and some epic hikes.\n### Don't Miss\n- Barbecuing seafood to your heart's content\n- Itoshima's incredible winter surf season\n- Excellent hiking, and the stunning Shiraito Falls\n## How to Get There\nTo truly enjoy Itoshima, a car is the best option. Public transport is available in the area but is very infrequent.\n### A scenic coastline\nThe most scenic way to Itoshima from Fukuoka is to follow the coastline around the peninsula. The road winds in and out of the bays, and you'll likely find yourself stopping to take pictures before you get anywhere near your planned destination.\n### Beaches, beaches everywhere\nThe further you get into Itoshima, the prettier the beaches become.\nFutamigaura is considered the sunset strip and is home to several excellent beachside cafes and a couple of surf shops where you can rent surfboards, bodyboards and standup paddleboards. Futamigaura is also home to Meoto Iwa, a pair of frequently photographed \"husband and wife\" rocks linked together by a rope.\nKeya Beach is equally scenic, and there are several surf points between Keya Beach and Futamigaura Beach. The sunset at Nogita Beach is ranked in the top 100 sunsets in Japan and has several well-known cafes, including Hinode. This local favorite serves tacos topped with locally grown vegetables at reasonable prices.\n### A cyclist's paradise\nThe smooth roads, open flats and scenery make the peninsula a cyclist's paradise. It takes a little effort to get out of Fukuoka and into Itoshima proper, but once you're there, you'll never look back. You'll not be the only one cycling on the roads either; Itoshima is frequented by everyone from day-tripping hobbyists to time trial superstars.\n### Inland giants\nHeading inland away from the coastline, the land rises steeply to mountains over 1,000 meters tall. An excellent hike brings you to the top of Raizan, and the Raizansennyoji Taihioin Temple is well worth a visit, with several towering trees that make for a perfect picture.\nShiraito Falls is a popular waterfall where you can enjoy the Japanese summer pastime of nagashi-somen, in which noodles are sent down a bamboo pipe and you must catch them with your chopsticks as they pass. There are several small pools with fish for children to catch, and some hiking paths that lead off from the waterfall.\n### Arts and crafts\nIt's good to spend some time in the villages around the peninsula, as many are home to unique arts and crafts shops. Studio Kura in Nijo hosts regular exhibitions alongside painting classes and has an ambitious artists in residence program that draws artists from abroad.\n### A winter treat\nDuring the winter, many of the port towns along the Itoshima Peninsula open kakigoya, temporary oyster huts where you can barbecue a wide variety of seafood including oysters. Though a relatively recent phenomenon, these oyster huts have proved incredibly popular, and the best ones require booking in advance.\n## Keywords"}

It is exceptionally popular with visitors. One reason is that famed swordmaster Miyamoto Musashi stayed in Kokura. The famous historical \"Battle of Ganryu Island\" between Miyamoto Musashi and his rival, Sasaki Kojiro, was also in Kokura.\nThe castle grounds are lovely, and the castle overlooks a new commercial complex called Riverwalk Kitakyushu with plenty of shopping, dining and entertainment possibilities. Nature lovers and birdwatchers will also enjoy a walk along the scenic Murasaki River, which gives the complex its name.\n### Don't Miss\n- The panoramic views of Kitakyushu City from the keep's top floor\n- Kokura Castle's grounds are covered with cherry bloom in mid-spring\n- Exploring Riverwalk Kitakyushu, a large entertainment and shopping complex\n## How to Get There\nKokura Castle is a short walk from Nishi-Kokura and Kokura stations.\nKokura Castle is a 10-minute walk from Nishi-Kokura Station, which is on the Kagoshima Main Line.\nIt's a 15-minute walk from the bigger Kokura Station. Kokura Station is also a stop on the Sanyo Shinkansen, which offers direct access from Fukuoka and Osaka.\n### Explore the castle\nKokura Castle played a pivotal role in the history of the area. Construction started at the beginning of the Edo period (1603-1867) in 1602, and took about seven years. The castle was the property of the Ogasawara clan between 1632 and 1866 but was burnt down in 1866 during the war between the Kokura and Choshu clans.\nThe current keep is not an accurate reconstruction of the original since the townspeople opted for a more aesthetically appealing design instead of faithfully rebuilding the simpler structure that once stood here.\nFrom the outside, the keep appears to have only four stories but actually has five inside. The castle is filled with exhibits that introduce the history of Kokura and the castle. The display sections include an interactive zone that allows visitors to experience samurai life as it was lived during the Edo period.\nFrom the top floor of the castle, you can enjoy a panoramic view of Kitakyushu to the west, south, and east.\n### Stroll the historic castle grounds\nThe keep is surrounded by a moat on two sides and the castle's extensive grounds on the other two. The grounds are collectively known as Katsuyama Park, which has hundreds of cherry trees that bloom in early April. In 1998, a small Japanese garden and pond were built within the castle environs. Within the garden and overlooking the keep is a traditional samurai study with tatami rooms.\nThe most famous samurai connected with Kokura Castle was the swordsman and artist Miyamoto Musashi, who is believed to have visited the castle in 1632.The park has a monument to Musashi. Niten Ichi-ryu, the school of swordsmanship based on his style of fighting with two swords, shines brilliantly in the history of this area.\n### Cafes and river views at Riverwalk Kitakyushu\nThe castle overlooks Riverwalk Kitakyushu, a large entertainment complex of open-air cafes and spaces with views of the river and its surroundings. Riverwalk Kitakyushu is also attached to the Kitakyushu Performing Arts Center and a branch of the Kitakyushu Municipal Museum of Art.\nDesigned as a natural and open space within the city, Riverwalk Kitakyushu is a great place to relax, take in some culture and grab a bite to eat before or after exploring Kokura Castle.\n## Keywords"}

Among these, two reign supreme: Kyoto's Kitano Tenmangu and Fukuoka's Dazaifu Tenmangu, which is built above the grave of Michizane. Dazaifu Tenmangu Shrine itself is magnificent, and it is further complemented by extensive grounds covered with thousands of beautiful plum trees.\n### Don't Miss\n- The plum blossoms: Over 6,000 plum trees are planted in the shrine's grounds and blossom in unison every March\n- Shops selling souvenirs and snacks lining Dazaifu Tenmangu's entrance\n- The Kyushu National Museum, one of only four national museums built in Japan\n## How to Get There\nDazaifu Tenmangu is easy to access from Fukuoka City by public transport.\nTake the Nishitetsu Line from Nishitetsu-Fukuoka Tenjin Station to Dazaifu Station, changing at Futsukaichi. Dazaifu Tenmangu is a five-minute walk from Dazaifu Station.\n### Heading to the shrine\nThe road leading to the shrine is lined with shops offering umegae mochi, the locally loved rice cakes filled with sweet red bean paste. There are also a number of ice cream stands selling flavors that are entirely unique to Japan, such as green tea, black sesame, and kinako (sweet soybean), along with countless shops for buying souvenirs and knick-knacks.\n### Entering the grounds\nBefore reaching the main shrine, take a moment to explore its grounds. Part of the appeal of Dazaifu Tenmangu is that it feels completely isolated from the bustle of everyday city life.\nAfter entering the grounds through a large torii gate, a set of three bridges run across a pond filled with koi carp and terrapin turtles. The pond is shaped in the Japanese kanji character for heart. Ancient moss-covered camphor trees are propped up on stilts on the edge of the lake, and the banks are populated by some of the plum trees for which Dazaifu Tenmangu is famous.\n### The heart of Dazaifu Tenmangu\nThe main hall, or Honden, of Dazaifu Tenmangu is built over the grave of Michizane Sugawara, a scholar, politician and poet who rose to great prominence during the 9th century before being exiled to Dazaifu due to a fierce rivalry with the Fujiwara clan. He died in Dazaifu in 903, and it is thought that the earliest iteration of Dazaifu Tenmangu (the inner courtyard) was built in 913.\nFollowing his death, Japan was plagued by natural disasters, and the government interpreted these events as the result of a curse placed upon them by the spirit of Michizane. The government decided to appease Michizane's spirit by building the Dazaifu Tenmangu Shrine for his spirit, in the process deifying Michizane as Tenman-Tenjin, the God of literature and calligraphy.\n### Japan's flying plum tree\nTo the right of the main shrine is Dazaifu Tenmangu's most famous plum tree, known as Tobiume, or flying plum tree. Legend has it that after Michizane left Kyoto for his life in exile, this particular tree yearned for Michizane so much that it uprooted itself and flew to reunite with him in Dazaifu.\nMichizane had a long-standing love of plum trees. It is said he composed his first poem at age five, which read, \"How beautiful the red plum blossom, I wish to color my cheek with it.\"\n### Exam success\nDue to Michizane's close association with learning, many Japanese visit the shrine to pray for success in their upcoming exams. Charms are available for purchase from the shrine office on the side of the Gohonden (main sanctuary). During exam season, huge numbers of ema (wooden plaque) charms can be seen hanging around the shrine's grounds.\n### Discover the shrine's fascinating history\nFor those interested in the life and times of Michizane, head to the Kanko Historical Museum, a small building behind the shrine depicting the main events of Michizane life through dioramas.\nThe Kyushu National Museum, up the hill from Dazaifu Tenmangu, offers more comprehensive information on the scholar's precocious rise to prominence and sudden exile to Dazaifu, as well as other superb exhibits.\n### Festivals\nDazaifu Tenmangu hosts several festivals during the year. An annual umeshu (plum liqueur) festival is held each March to coincide with the plum blossoms. Also in March, the Kyokusui-no-en Festival sees Waka poets dressed in kimono sit along a small stream, where they work to compose a poem before a cup of sake reaches them.\nAn event known as Usokae is held every January, in which participants exchange carvings of wooden bullfinches in a ceremony designed to cast off evil. One of these carvings is painted gold, and the person who receives the bullfinch is supposed to have a lucky year ahead.\n## Keywords"}

The sweeping grasslands of the area are scattered with white limestone mounds and conical sinkholes. The Karst extends along rolling mountains and has multiple trails with expansive panoramas of the Shikoku region and the Pacific Ocean.\n### Don't Miss\n- The mossy trails and ancient trees of Keyakidaira\n- Other-worldly stargazing opportunities\n- Scenic hikes and stunning seasonal blooms\n## How to Get There\nHard to reach by public transport and therefore suited to intrepid travelers, this pristine natural hideout can be accessed by car from Kochi and Matsuyama or a combination of taxi, bus and train travel from Kochi Station.\nIf you choose to rent a car, the scenic drive from either Kochi or Matsuyama takes around two hours. The journey by public transport and taxi requires a number of changes.\nTo get there via public transport, depart from Kochi Station and arrive at Susaki Station to catch a bus towards Yusuhara. Change again at Shinden and take a taxi to Hoshifuru Village Tengu (formerly Tenguso), in the middle of the Karst. During the winter months, some areas of the Karst become inaccessible due to snow.\n### Quick Facts\nThe area is split into three parts; the Tengu Highland, Keyakidaira and Mezurudaira\nThe karst has an elevation of 1,400 meters\nThe area straddles both Ehime and Kochi prefectures\n### A place for all seasons\nThe Shikoku Karst transitions seamlessly with the seasons. Spring sees the grasses turn a vibrant hue of green. On hikes through the area in summer, you can see lilies all around. Old man of the mountain and forget-me-nots also dot the hillsides.\nRich, vibrant leaves cover the trees during fall months, whilst the grass turns a striking shade of silver. Then in the winter, you may find a dusting of the purest white snow covering the hillsides.\n### Forest bathing\nThe hiking trail in the Tengu Highlands that passes through Tengu Forest is a great way to soak up the area's incredible beauty. Look out for the Japanese cypress wood-chip paths meandering through the forest, which are surrounded by stunning white birch and red pine trees.\nThe walk takes approximately three hours and at the end of it, you are rewarded with fantastic views of the Shikoku mountains and on a clear day, the Pacific Ocean.\n### The great outdoors\nDuring summer months, camping is the perfect way to immerse yourself in the tranquil atmosphere of the Karst. The Mezurudaira area has plenty of campsites where you'll find pastoral scenes of cows lazily grazing. The Karst is so far from any major cities there is little to no light pollution, making it the perfect spot to stargaze.\n### A riot of color\nThe nearby Ogawamine area includes several notable mountains. Kasatori, Ogawamine, Mikawamine, and Ubahodo all reach heights of between 900 and 1,500 meters. In spring, the mountains are carpeted with the bold magenta rhododendron flowers. On a clear day, you can see Mt. Ishizuchi and the Sata Peninsula nearby.\n### Warm hospitality\nIn the midst of the Karst's Highlands sits the Hoshifuru Village Tengu (formerly Tenguso) and Mezuruso Cottages. Taste the flavors of the mountains, such as pheasant and wild boar served alongside the best of seasonal produce.\nHoshifuru Village Tengu has a large bath which looks over the Pacific and the Ishizuchi mountains, and is the perfect place to unwind after a long day of hiking. At Mezuruso, try amago, a red spotted masu trout from the nearby rivers of Kumakogen, cooked on an outdoor charcoal fire. Both accommodations also have campsites.\n### Starlight, waterfalls and fairytale villages\nMuch like Shirakawa-go, the thatched farmhouse village of Kumakogen Furusato Ryoko Mura could have been lifted from a fairytale. The planetarium and observatory offer unimpeded views of the twinkling night skies. Nearby, Omogo Gorge and Goraiko and Gongen waterfalls draw visitors with their clear rippling waters and dense surrounding forest.\n## Keywords"}

Winding through the mountains of Honshu's Kii Peninsula, an area straddling Wakayama, Nara, Osaka and Mie prefectures, it's been walked by pilgrims on their quest for enlightenment for over a millennium.\nModern travelers come to experience moments of quiet contemplation, commune with nature, and go deep into Japan's spiritual history.\n### Don't Miss\n- Treading the same paths as past pilgrims, including ascetics, samurai, emperors, and monks\n- Kumano Nachi-taisha Shrine and its temple, a perfect example of Shinto-Buddhist fusion\n- Taking advantage of the luggage shuttle services along the route so you can trek baggage free\n## How to Get There\nThe pilgrimage trails crisscross the Kii Peninsula, and access depends on your ultimate destination and how far you wish to hike. The main means of transportation to the area are Osaka, Kyoto, and Nagoya using the Kisei Mainline (also known as the Kinokuni line).\nTo access Kumano Nachi Taisha Shrine and Nachi Seigantoji Temple, take a 30-minute bus from Kii-Katsuura Station (on the JR Kinokuni Line) to the parking lot in front of the shrine and temple.\nAccess Kumano Hayatama Taisha via a 15-minute walk from JR Shingu Station, also on the JR Kinokuni Line.\nKumano Hongu Taisha is approximately an hour and 15 minutes from Kii-Tanabe Station (on the JR Kinokuni Line) via Ryujin Bus on the Kumano Hongu Line. Get off at Kumano Hongu Taisha-mae.\n### Quick Facts\nThe entire pilgrimage route is made up of seven trails\nIn 2004 the traditional trails along with their holy mountains were designated a UNESCO World Heritage site\nA mythical three-legged crow is the symbol of the Kumano Kodo, and of Japan's national soccer team\n### Kumano, the dwelling place of the gods\nSince its earliest days, the Kumano region has been regarded as a spiritually powerful area where gods inhabit the very fabric of the natural landscape.\nDuring the Heian Period (794-1185), former emperors began making the arduous trek to the region in search of spiritual enlightenment. The pilgrimage gradually became more widely known from that time.\n### The spiritual triumvirate of Kumano Sanzan\nKumano Sanzan is the collective name for the area's three most sacred shrines: Kumano Hayatama Taisha Shrine, Kumano Nachi Taisha Shrine (including adjoining Nachi Seigantoji Temple) and Kumano Hongu Taisha Shrine.\nTogether they are the sacred center of the Kumano region. Uniquely designed and originally offering separate forms of nature worship, the three eventually merged, becoming a major pilgrimage destination.\n### 99 Oji Shrines as spiritual signposts\nWhile the Kumano Sanzan shrines remain the big draw of the pilgrimage, many smaller shrines are scattered along the route. Known as the 99 Oji Shrines, their purpose is to provide protection and guidance for the wandering pilgrims.\n### Religious harmony through Shinbutsu-shugo\nBefore political policy forced them apart in the late 19th century, Buddhism and Shinto coexisted quite peacefully as Shinbutsu-shugo, a fusion of the two belief systems. Shinto gods were considered to be indigenous manifestations of Buddhist deities. This was the norm in Japan for over a thousand years.\nIn the 19th century, Buddhism was separated from Shinto and many temples and Buddhist statues were destroyed.\nWhile it's relatively rare to find Buddhist and Shinto elements intertwined today, Kumano Nachi Taisha Shrine and the adjoining Nachi Seigantoji Temple illustrate the traditional relationship very well.\n## Keywords"}
