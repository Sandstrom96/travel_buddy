The structure did\nnot have a roof and pediment.\nThe construction of the\ntemple, which ranks among\nthe biggest in antiquity, was\ncompleted in 131 AD by the\nRoman Emperor _Hadrian_. It\nis of Corinthian order (110m\nin length and approximately\n44m in width), three rows of\neight columns at the narrow\nsides and two rows of twenty\ncolumns at its long sides.\nInside the temple there was a\ngold and ivory statue of Zeus\nwhich does not exist today.\n```\nIlissos Valley.\n```\nThe surviving section of the\n_Ilissos river valley_ (right behind\nthe temple of Olympian Zeus)\nis worth a visit. In antiquity\nthe Ilissos river was known\nas the sacred river of the\nMuses. Scattered remains of\nancient sanctuaries are located\nin the valley. You will find\n```\nnearby the rock of the Kalliroi\nspring – which was famous in\nantiquity – and the church of\nAyia Fotini, which was built in\n1872 at the site of an ancient\ntemple, on the foundation\nof the sacred sanctuary of\nEkati.

In this theatre, the\nmost famous ancient Greek\npoets, _Aeschylus, Aristophanes,\nEuripides,_ and _Sophocles_ saw\npremiere performances of\ntheir plays in the 5th century\nBC. The auditorium and the\nproscenium were made of wood.\nIn the 4th century BC they were\nreconstructed using marble.\nSections of the stone auditorium\nsurvive. According to experts,\nthe theatre had a capacity of\n17,000.

The arch provided shelter\nto theatregoers in case of bad\nweather or shade from the sun.\nNearby are the ruins of the\n_Asclepieion of Athens_ , which\nwas built in 429 BC, following\nthe plague, which decimated\nthe population.\n6 THE ODEION OF\nHERODES ATTICUS\nThe Odeion of Herodes\nAtticus was built in 161 AD by\nthe wealthy _Herodes Tiberius\nClaudius Atticus_ , a teacher\nand philosopher, who inherited\na fortune from his father.\nHerodes Atticus constructed\nthe covered Odeion in memory\nof his wife Regilla. Ancient\nGreeks organised events in the\nOdeion. Nowadays, the 5,000-\nseat theatre is a venue for\nconcerts of the _Athens Festival_\n(see page 126).

Before reaching the\nPropylaea, you will pass\nthrough the _Beulé gate_ , part\nof the Roman fortifications of\nthe Acropolis. Right after that\nyou will encounter a 13 m.\nhigh pedestal, known as the\n_“monument of Agrippa”_ , on\nwhich the Athenians in 27 B.C.\nerected a statue of the Roman\nMarcus Agrippa, benefactor of\nthe city.\n7. 2 The Temple of the\nAthena Victory (Wingless\nVictory)\nsouth of the _Propylaea_ ,\nwas built circa 420 BC in\ncommemoration of the victory\nof the Greeks against the\nPersians. The temple was\nthe work of the architect\n_Kallikrates_. The site was the\nlocation of a sanctuary in the\nprehistoric era. To the left of\nthe temple you will find the\n_Erechtheion_. Facing the temple\nis the _Parthenon_.\n```\n7.3 The Parthenon\nis an architectural\nmasterpiece of great renown.\nYou will appreciate its\nsplendour if you visit, and\nlearn about the history and the\nsecrets of the construction\nof the Parthenon. This\nunique temple, dedicated\nto the goddess Athena , was\nbuilt of Pentelic marble. The\nParthenon of the classical\nera was built on the remains\nof the monumental earlier\nParthenon , an archaic temple\nbuilt in the late 6th century\nBC. The architects of the\nclassical temple, which was\nconstructed and decorated\nfrom 447-432BC (in the\ngolden age of Pericles), were\nIktinos and Kallikrates. It is a\nDoric peripteral temple with\n8 columns on the front and\nthe back and 17 columns on\neach side. In the Parthenon\nstood the chryselephantine\nstatue of Athena, the work of\nthe famous sculptor Pheidias ,\nwho was also in charge of\nthe overall construction. The\nstatue was the destination of\nthe great procession of the\nPanathenaea, depicted on the\nfrieze of the temple.\n```\n#### ANTIQUITIES IN ATHENSTour of Athens, stage 1:\n```\n8\n```\n12\n_9.

The\nsouthern\nbalcony of the\nErechtheion\nwith the famous\nCaryatids._\n```\nThe chryselephantine\nstatue of Athena.\nAccording to mythology,\nthe name of the city is\nconnected with a rivalry\nbetween Poseidon and Athena\nfor the guardianship of the\ncity. Poseidon offered the\nAthenians a horse, while\nAthena, struck the rock of\nthe Acropolis with her spear,\nand an olive tree sprouted.\nThe Athenians preferred the\nolive tree, which symbolised\npeace and prosperity. The\ncity was named after Athena.\nThe 12-metre high statue\nstood in the Parthenon. The\ninterior of the statue was\nmade of wood, while the nude\nparts were made of ivory.\nThe removable robe and the\nhelmet were coated with gold\nplating. The statue, which\nrepresented the goddess\nAthena bearing arms, and on\nher right hand a 2-metre high\nivory statue of victory, was\nlost in the early Byzantine\nera. Ancient sources, and\nthe analytical descriptions of\nPausanias (2nd century AD),\ntestify to the existence of the\nstatue. Archaeologists have\nderived information about the\nstatue from copies. The most\n```\n```\nfamous copy is the Varvakeios\nAthena.\n```\n7. 4 The Erechtheion\nwas built from 420-\nBC at the most holy site of\nthe Acropolis, where goddess\nAthena planted the olive\ntree, her sacred symbol. The\ntree was later destroyed by\nPersian invaders. According\nto mythology, following the\nexpulsion of the Persians,\nthe tree miraculously\nsprouted again.\n_Caryatids:_\nThe figures of the maidens\nsupporting the roof of the\nsouthern balcony of the temple\nare copies.

It is\nconstructed on two levels.\nIt is asymmetrical and has\ntwo balconies, which are not\nthematically connected to\neach other. The small balcony\non the south side is better\nknown, mainly due to the\nsix _Caryatids_ that support\nthe roof. The differences\nbetween the sections of the\ntemple may be due to the\nfact that the various parts are\ndedicated to various gods.\nThe eastern section was\ndedicated to Athena Poliada,\nand the western section to\nPoseidon Erechtheus.\n```\nThe Acropolis Museum\n(see page 41)\n```\n(^8) THE AREIOS PAGOS\nThe Areios Pagos, venerated\nin antiquity, is the most\nancient law court of the\nworld. It was the seat of the\nfirst aristocratic assembly of\nancient Athens. The assembly\ngradually lost political\ninfluence and in the latter half\nof the 5th century, it retained\nsolely its function as a court,\nmostly hearing murder cases.\nThe _Oresteia_ describes the\ntrial at this court of _Orestes_\nfor the murder of his mother\n_Clytemnaestra_ , and her lover\n_Aegisthus_. Apostle Paul spoke\nto the Athenians at the Areios\nPagos in 51 AD. A bronze\nplaque on the base of the hill\ncommemorates his sermons.\n(^9) PHILOPAPPOU HILL\nWell worth a visit any\ntime of the year.

The\nassembly is thought to have\nhad a capacity of 10,000.\n11\nTHE ANCIENT AGORA\nThe archaeological area\nof the ancient Agora is\nlocated on the foothills of\nthe Acropolis , near Thission\nMetro Station. In antiquity,\nthe Agora was not solely a\ncommercial centre. It was also\nan important political, cultural\nand religious centre. In the\narea of the agora were located\nadministrative buildings,\ntemples, public services\nand courts.

The monuments\nlocated there were built in\nvarious historical periods:\nfrom the classical age to the\n11 th century AD. The church\nof _Ayioi Apostoloi_ was built\nin the 11th century (see page\n22).\n**THE SIGHTS:**\n11.1 Thission (Theseion) -\nTemple of Hephaistos.\nThission was dedicated to\n_Hephaistos_ and _Athena_ , and\nnot _Theseus_. It is located in\nthe western perimeter of the\nAgora. It is the best-preserved\ntemple of antiquity. It was\nbuilt in 460-415 BC. In the\ntemple stood the statues\nof _Hephaistos_ and _Athena_ ,\nthought to have been sculpted\nby _Alkamenes_.\n11.2 The monument of the\nEponymous Heroes.\nHere stood the statues of\nthe ten heroes of Attica (4th\ncentury BC). The ten clans of\nAttica were named after the\nheroes. Public announcements\nwere displayed on the\npedestal of these statues.\n```\n11.3 Poikile Stoa.\nIt is thought that Poikile\nStoa derived its name from\nthe variety of the colours\nand themes of its murals.\nThe name “Poikile” (poikile\nmeans diverse) leads us to the\nsupposition that the murals\nhere were painted in a variety\nof colours and themes. Here\nZinon taught Stoic philosophy,\nwhich was named after Poikile\nStoa (460 BC).\n11.4 The Stoa of Attalus.\nThe Stoa of Attalus, a two-\nfloor building, was donated by\nthe King of Pergamum Attalus\nII (159-138 BC) to the city\nof Athens. It is thought to\nhave been a kind of ancient\ncommercial centre with 21\nshops on each floor. The\ncollection of the Museum\ndisplays everyday objects, which\nwere unearthed in excavations\nin the ancient Agora. Visitors\nmay get an idea of everyday life\nin ancient Athens.\n11.5 The Basileios Stoa.\nThe Basileios Stoa,\nconstructed circa 500 BC,\nis located on the foothills of\nThission.

According\nto the geographer Pausanias ,\nthe location was named\nafter Keramos. However, the\nplace was most likely named\nafter the neighbourhood of\nthe kerameis (potters). (The\ndefinition of Kerameikos\nis something related to\nceramics or potters). The\nneighbourhood of the\nkerameis was established on\nthe banks of the river Iridanos.\nYou can see the riverbed in\nthe archaeological area. The\nancient Demos of Kerameikos\ncovered a large area. Only part\nof it has been unearthed in\nexcavations. It is thought that\nthe area of the Kerameikos\nwas bounded by the north-\nwestern perimeter of the\nAgora on one side and the\ncopse that was named after\nthe hero Akademos , on the\nother side.\n```\n```\nThe festival of the\nPanathenaea.\nEvery year the ancient\nAthenians celebrated the Mikra\n(small) Panathenaea , and every\nfour years they celebrated the\nMegala (great) Panathenaea ,\nwhich were grander and\nincluded horse racing, athletic\ncontests, competitions in music\nand other activities. On the last\nday of the festival, a procession\nbegan at Kerameikos , (the\npreparation of the procession\nwould take place in a large 5th\ncentury B.C. building with a\nperistyle central court named\nPompeion next to the Dipylon).\nThe procession passed through\nthe Agora and ascended the\nAcropolis , where a veil named\nPeplon was offered to goddess\nAthena. According to custom,\nduring the festival, statues were\ncovered with real clothes. The\nrobe of the gods was basically\na woollen tunic, woven by a\npriestess assisted by young\nvirgins. It was placed on the\nmast of a large wooden boat\nas its sail and carried to the\nAcropolis. The procession\nfollowed the boat.

You will\nbe impressed by the treasures\nof the museum and will want\nto come back for another\nvisit. However, if you come\njust once, be sure to have\nenough time. The museum\ncontains approximately\n11,000 masterpieces dating\nfrom the 7th millennium B.C\nto the 5th century B.C which\nare classified in 7 collections:\n_Prehistoric_ (Neolithic, Cycladic\nand Mycenaean antiquities,\nrooms 3-6 and 48 on the\n1 st floor), _Sculptures_ (rooms\n7-35), _Bronze_ (rooms 36-\n39), _Egyptian Antiquities_\n(rooms 40-41, of world-wide\nimportance), _Stathatou_ (room\n42 with 970 works of art\nmainly miniatures), _Vases and\nMiniatures_ (rooms 49-63\n1 st floor) and _Cypriot_ (room\n64 1st floor). In addition to\nthe permanent exhibits, the\n```\nMuseum also holds temporary\nexhibitions and educational\nprograms. We list some of the\nexhibits of the museum:\nThe golden mask of\nAgamemnon\n(Room 4). Although it has\nbeen proven that it is not the\nmask of Agamemnon , it is a\nnoteworthy exhibit, well worth\nseeing. Schliemann’s theory\nwas mistaken – today it is\nthought to be the mask of a\nking who died three centuries\nbefore Agamemnon (16th\ncentury BC). In the gallery of\nMycenaean Antiquities , other\nthan the mask, you can see\njewels, golden works of art,\nswords etc, found in the royal\ngraves of Mycenae.\nThe Harper of Keros.\n(Room 6). It dates back to\nthe early Bronze era (2700-\n2300 B.C) and is one of the\nmost ancient depictions of\nmusicians of Early Cycladic idol\nsculpture. It represents a man\nseated on a throne holding a\nharp or lyre in his right hand,\nwith a raised head and slightly\nopen thighs.\n```\n###### MUSEUMS\n```\n86\n```\n76\n_87.

This attractive,\nwell-preserved statue from\nElefsina was sculpted from\naround 440-430 BC. It\ndepicts Dimitra giving hay to\nTriptolemos , the young king\nof Elefsina. To her right, her\ndaughter Persephone gives\nher blessing. Notice that\nthe Triptolemos and Dimitra\nhave different sizes. In that\nperiod artists made gods\ntaller when they were depicted\nwith mortals on a dedicatory\ncolumn - a sign of respect of\nthe gods.\nThe Poseidon (or Zeus) of\nArtemission\n(Room 15). Is it perhaps a\nstatue of Poseidon or of Zeus?\nArchaeologists have not come\nup with an answer. The bronze\nstatue, a masterpiece of the\nsculpture of the classical\nperiod, is 2.09 metres high.\nIt is one of the few preserved\noriginal bronze statues.\n```\n```\nMyrrine’s oil-flask.\n(Room 16).

According to the\nepigram located on her head,\nthe god’s purpose was to bring\nthe woman to Pluto (god of\nHades ). Three men, relatives of\nMyrrine observe the spectacle.\n(430-420 BC).\nThe stele of Hegeso.\n(Room 18). Don’t fail to see\nthe famous column (stele)\nof Hegeso (5th century BC). It\nwas discovered in Kerameikos\n(see page 17). There is copy\nof the column in Kerameikos.\nThe sculpture depicts Hegeso\nseated, taking a jewel from a\nbox.

The\ninscription on the pedestal\nstates that he is a boxer.\nExcepting for the left hand,\nwhich is thought to be the\nproduce of a posterior repair,\nthe statue is thought to be a\nmasterpiece. It is thought to\nbe the work of _Praxiteles_ , or his\nstudent (330BC).\nThe Adolescent of Antikythira\n_(Room 28)._ Archaeologists\nhave varying opinions\nregarding the significance of\nthe statue. The main subject\nholds a spherical object in his\nhand. Some archaeologists\nclaim that the statue depicts\n```\nthe god Pan holding an apple,\nwhile others claim that it is the\nstatue of Perseus holding the\nhead of Andromeda (340 BC).\nIt was found in a shipwreck in\nthe vicinity of Antikythira in\n1900.\nThe head of Hygeia.\n(Sculpture rooms). Discovered\nin the temple of Alea Athena\nin Tegea the head of Hygeia\nwas apparently part of a statue\n(350-340 BC), attributed\nto sculptor Scopas.

Hippodamus plans were\nused as the guidelines for\nthe reconstruction of the city\nin 1834. Themistocles was\nthe first person to realise the\nimportance of the role the\ncity could play for Athens. He\nmade Piraeus Athens’s leading\nport, relegating the Bay of\nFaliro , which the Athenians\nused before the 5th century\nBC. Seeking to develop a\nfortified port for the city of\nAthens, from 493 to 479 BC\nhe built the wall of Piraeus.\nLater Pericles completed the\nfortification, building the Long\nWalls , which protected both\nsides of the road from Piraeus\nto Athens.
