In antiquity, its major city was Ab-\ndera (Avdira). In the 1st c. AD, the apostle Paul preached Christianity in the area which, at that time,\nwas a Roman province. In the Byzantine era, the settlements that rose to prominence were Polystylon\n(which succeeded Abdera), Topeiros, Xantheia, and Pori. For a short period during the Turkish Oc-\ncupation (1829-1870), the local capital was Yeniséa (Yenije). After its devastation by fire (1870),\nYenisea declined and passed its “scepter” on to the city of Xanthi. The area, which became an integral\npart of Greece in May 1920, borders to the East on Rodopi district; on the North are Rodopi mountains\nwith Bulgaria beyond; to the West it borders on Drama and Kavala districts, and to the South it is\nwashed by the Thracian Sea.\n3. Xanthi’s central Dimokratia Square and its distinctive clock tower.\n### T\n```\nXANTHI\n```\n5\n**Xanthi 1**\nThe “Noblewoman of Thrace”, as Xanthi is\ncalled, is built on the slopes of western Rodopi\nand captivates visitors with its old town: Re-\nsearchers believe that it occupies the site of an-\ncient Xantheia, a city founded by the Thracian\ntribe of Kikones and mentioned for the first time\nby Strabo. During Byzantine times (13th-14th\ncent. AD), Xanthi was the most important urban\ncentre in the district. Under Turkish rule it was\ncalled Iskeje and emerged as a major commer-\ncial centre where tobacco was produced, proc-\nessed and traded. By the 18th century Xanthi\nand Yenisea had made a name for themselves\ninternationally as two significant centres of\ntobacco trade until 1829 when a devastating\nearthquake levelled the former. Nevertheless,\nthe opening of the Thessaloniki-Constantinople\nrailroad in 1891 and, later on, the foundation of\nthe Democritus University of Thrace (after 1974)\ncontributed to the city’s economic revival. **Dis-\ntance northeast from Athens:** 738 km. **Dis-\ntance northeast from Thessaloniki:** 225 km.\n**City promenade**\n- The **old town of Xanthi**.

One of the\nfirst buildings visitors notice in the old town is\n**Demarcheion** (Town Hall), commissioned in\n1830 by Moses, a Jewish tobacco merchant. On\nOrfeos Street, a traditional establishment of the\nold town houses the **Municipal Art Gallery.**\nThe **Folk Art Museum** maintained by the\nFriends of Progress Association of\nXanthi (FEX) is located nearby\nin the elegant **mansions**\nthat had once belonged\nto the **tobacco mer-\nchants Athanasios\nand Pantelis Kou-\ngioumtzoglou** .The\nwalls and ceilings\n```\nof the two mansions are decorated by murals\npainted by German artists.

It has many beautiful vistas (Lakes Vistonida and\nIsmarida), rich flora and fauna found on the mountainous part on the east of the\nprefecture, archaeological sites, and traditional small villages. Its capital is Komotini, a city with\na long historic course throughout which the Christian and Muslim populations have co-existed\npeacefully.\nOn the basis of archaeological finds, the district was first inhabited in prehistoric period. During\nhistoric times, its most significant city was Maroneia, which was founded by Chian settlers\nin the mid-seventh cent. BC. In the Byzantine era, cities such as Maroneia, Mosyno(u)polis,\nAnastassioupolis, and Gratianoupolis played a key role in this region. From the 10th to the 14th c.\nAD, Papikion mountain became a preeminent monastic centre. The area was taken by the Turks\nin 1361. During the years of Turkish rule, Komotini became a major urban centre in the area until\nit was finally incorporated into the Greek state in 1920. Presently, the Democritus University of\nThrace, the new industrial plants in the area as well as the construction of Egnatia highway have\nsignificantly contributed to the region’s growth. On the North the district of Rodopi is separated\nfrom Bulgaria by the Rodopi Mountains; on the West it borders on the district of Xanthi and on\nthe East on the district of Evros; to the South it is washed by the Thracian Sea.\n```\n11.

At that time,\nKomotini was merely a small fortified settlement,\na station, on the Via Egnatia. In the 14th c. «Ko-\nmotena» or «Komotini» (Gregoras) or «Koumout-\nzina» (Cantacuzenus) grew into a significant city.\nIts population increased due to the installation of\nrefugees from the devastated city of Mosynoupo-\nlis. The Ottoman Turks captured the town in 1361.\nDuring the Turkish Occupation, the city, then\nnamed Gümülcine, rose to prominence. During\nthe second half of the 19th c. it reached its peak as\na major centre of agricultural and livestock breed-\ning activities for the greater area. It was liberated\nin 1913 but did not become a part of Greece until\nMay 1920, after the Treaty of Sèvres, receiving a\nlarge influx of refugees in 1922-1923.

The Hellenistic\ntombs that have been unearthed in the village of\nLagyna (14 km S) showcase that Soufli has been\ninhabited since the Alexandrian era.

The second main\noccupation of Soufli residents next to silkworm\nbreeding was wine making; in the 19th century,\nthe production of wine in Soufli reached 2,000,000\nliters.
