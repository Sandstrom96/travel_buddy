Explore the ruins and restored castles of the Ryukyu kings, and visit magnificent beaches and coastlines with an amazing array of coral and undersea life. Come for whale watching and dragon boat races, rare flora and fauna, and an island mindset that makes you forget the clock and follow the sun.\n## How to Get There\nFrom mainland Japan, most flights to Okinawa's Naha Airport depart from Tokyo or Osaka. If you're coming from China, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan or Hong Kong, there are direct international flights to Okinawa.\nThere are frequent flights from Tokyo to Naha on Okinawa's main island every day as well as direct flights to the outlying island of Ishigaki. There are also seasonal direct flights to Miyako Island. You can also catch connecting flights to the outlying islands of Miyako, Ishigaki, Yonaguni and Kume from Naha Airport.\nThe best way to get around Okinawa is by rental car, or by bicycle or scooter in some areas. If you prefer public transportation, there is a monorail running from Naha Airport through Naha to the old capital of Shuri. There is also a comprehensive bus service on the main island, and ferry services run between nearby islands.\n### Don’t Miss\n- UNESCO World Heritage sites on the main island, including Shuri Castle and the ruins of Tamagusuku area. Shuri Castle was destroyed by fire in 2019, but visitors can see the valuable reconstruction of the castle until its completion in 2026\n- Whale sharks and the fascinating, diverse sea life at Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium\n- Relaxing on white sand beaches and swimming in clear blue ocean waters\n- Enjoy the beautiful nature of Yanbaru and Iriomote Island, both World Natural Heritage sites\n## Explore Okinawa by Area\n- \\\\\nNaha\n- \\\\\nIshigaki Island\n- \\\\\nMiyako Island\n- \\\\\nKerama Islands\n## Trending Attractions in Okinawa\n- Okinawa Churaumi AquariumOkinawa Churaumi Aquarium\\\\\nOkinawa Churaumi Aquarium\n- Shuri Castle\\\\\nShuri Castle\n- KOKUSAI DORI\\\\\nKokusai-dori Street\n- Blue Cave\\\\\nBlue Cave & Around\n- Himeyuri Memorial Tower\\\\\nHimeyuri Memorial Tower\n## Local Specialties\n- Awamori\nA liquor unique to Okinawa made from Indica long-grain rice and aged in clay pots to mellow its fire. Awamori is most commonly served with water and ice, but it can also be enjoyed straight. A distinctive characteristic of Awamori is that the ingredients continue to mature over time, changing the flavor, and the aroma and taste become more mellow. Awamori that has been aged for more than three years is called kusu.\n- Traditional Textiles\nThe textiles of Okinawa are known for their high-quality craftsmanship. More than 10 traditional dyeing and weaving techniques have been handed down through generations. Materials like ramie plant fibers, cotton and silk are used for weaving, and kasuri ikat dyeing and \"hanaori\" weaving styles are used to create precise patterns. Each area of the prefecture has its own distinctive textiles. Bingata, produced in the southern region of the Okinawa main island, is known for its bright colors. Remote Miyako Island and the Yaeyama Islands produce Jofu ramie fabric with ikat patterns, while Kumejima Island produces Kumejima Tsumugi silk textiles. During the reign of the Ryukyu Kingdom (from the 15th century to the 19th century), \"tribute cloth\" was paid to the government as a form of tax from outlying islands, including Miyako, Yaeyama, Kume. These superior textiles were also used for trading with other kingdoms and ruling dynasties at the time. Okinawa is one of the largest producers of these fabrics in Japan today.\n- Okinawan Raw Sugar\nA mineral-rich brown sugar made from Okinawa sugar cane, with a mellow sweetness and a rich molasses flavor. The raw clumps of sugar are often eaten as a sweet treat during teatime.\n- Shiquasa\nThe shiquasa is Okinawa's answer to the lime. Rich in vitamin C and refreshingly tart, this citrus fruit is squeezed over grilled fish, blended into smoothies and even mixed into local awamori cocktails.\n- Goya Chanpuru\nBitter melon, as goya is known in English, packs a powerful punch. Eaten raw, goya can be overwhelming, but when mixed with egg, tofu, and Spam in the dish called goya chanpuru, it elevates a simple stir-fry to a culinary delight.\n- Soki Soba\nSoki are pork spare ribs simmered in awamori (a strong type of shochu), soy sauce and sugar. They are placed in noodle soup topped with scallions and pickled ginger. Call it ramen for the tropics.\n- Ryukyu Glass\nVibrantly colored Ryukyu glass has been around since the 19th century. Okinawan glassmakers first used broken glass pieces from foreign ships, sake and soy sauce bottles to produce unique designs. Ryukyu glass reflects natural colors—ocean blues and greens, sunrise oranges and yellows—and Okinawan values: don't waste, be adaptable, and value imperfection.\n- Sanshin\nA long-necked instrument that resembles a banjo, the sanshin has three strings and was once covered in snakeskin (newer instruments use nylon cloth). The sanshin has a distinctive sound that creates a perfect island mood.\n## Seasonal Highlights\n- Spring\nSpring comes early in Okinawa. Cherry blossoms bloom in late January and February and azaleas, irises, lilies and hydrangeas follow in April and May. Early spring is also the best time for whale watching off the coast of Zamami Island.\n- Summer\nOkinawa’s subtropical summer stretches from June to October, an open invitation to go waterfall trekking and explore the beaches, coral reefs and mangrove glades of these islands. Go snorkeingling, diving, kayaking and more.\n- Autumn\nThe humidity drops after the early fall typhoons, making this a great time to explore the islands while it's still warm enough to enjoy sand and sea. The Naha Giant Tug-of-War Festival and Shuri Castle Festival are autumn events that you won't want to miss.\n- Winter\nWinter in Okinawa is a comfortable 15°C. Divers can still explore the ocean in December, while January brings the whale-watching season. Take a scenic hike on Cape Manza or enjoy the illumination festivals during the holiday season."}

Ishigaki has a beautiful coastline with magnificent beaches and excellent hiking trails in the center of the island.\n### Don't Miss\n- Some of the best beaches in Okinawa\n- Diving with manta rays in Kabira Bay\n- Breathtaking views of the Yaeyama Islands\n## How to Get There\nYou can reach Ishigaki Island from Naha Airport and from Tokyo's Haneda Airport. There are also flights from Narita Airport in Tokyo, Chubu Centrair International Airport in Nagoya, Kansai International Airport in Osaka, Fukuoka Airport, Miyako Airport, and Yonaguni Airport.\nThere are frequent flights from Naha Airport to New Ishigaki Airport. You can also fly direct from Tokyo's Haneda Airport to Ishigaki Island. The trip takes about 3 hours. There is a bus service between the airport and the bus terminal in central Ishigaki. It runs regularly and takes about 45 minutes.\nA rental car is the ideal way to get around Ishigaki. You can get to almost anywhere you want to go on the island in less than an hour's drive.\n### About the island\nThe island has a population of around 49,000 people.\nWhile Ishigaki City has its charms, you'll discover the true wonders of Ishigaki Island when you head to the south of the island and explore its coastline. Other highlights include the mountainous area in the center and the scenic Hirakubo Penisula, a long peninsula jutting out from the northeastern part of the island. The area is sparsely populated and offers magnificent beaches and excellent hiking trails.\n### Beaches and beyond\nYou'll find some of the finest beaches anywhere in Okinawa on Ishigaki Island. Whether you are looking to laze around on the white sands, take a dip in the ocean or dive down to the coral paradise, the beaches on Ishigaki have you covered.\nOf the several beaches on the island, Maeza Beach is the nearest to the airport. It's a popular destination with a wonderful stretch of sand and sea, but there are more exciting prospects if you are willing to take a short drive.\nHead west from the airport, and you'll find the fabulous beaches of Fusaki, Sukuji, and Yonehara. They are all within an hour's drive from the airport. Fusaki Beach—directly west of Ishigaki City—is known for its fabulous sunsets, but its sun-drenched days are just as impressive. Jellyfish can be an unwelcome hazard when swimming in the summer months in Okinawa, but at Fusaki Beach there is a safety net around the bay to keep them out.\n### Family friendly\nUp in the northwest corner of Ishigaki Island, you'll come to Sukuji Beach, set in a graceful bay surrounded by trees. If you're traveling with young children, this is the ideal beach to visit. The water is very shallow, and the seabed is sandy. As with Fusaki Beach, there is a net to keep the jellyfish out in the summer.\nYonehara Beach is on the north side of the island, and it is the most popular destination. There is a campsite nearby, and the beach pulses with life. It is a good location for snorkeling and diving.\nA word of warning: despite its popularity, there are no lifeguards or jellyfish nets at Yonehara Beach, and there are strong currents in the bay.\n### Ride off into the sunset\nIf you are willing to drive a little farther, halfway up the Hirakubo Peninsula, you'll reach Sunset Beach. Most travelers head for the more easily reached destinations, so this beach is quieter and more secluded.\nWith the perfect combination of rolling sands, calm, shallow waters, deep diving spots, and spectacular coral reefs, it more than justifies the 50-minute drive from the airport. Jellyfish nets are spread out in the summer, and diving equipment rental and shower facilities are available.\n### Down among the manta\nThere are fine spots for snorkeling at many of the beaches on the island. For diving experts, don't miss the opportunity to dive with manta rays.\nThe mantas congregate in the summer months around Kabira Bay, near Sukuji Beach, and they are so abundant that you'll encounter them on almost every dive.\n### What to see inland\nThere are two beautiful mountains on Ishigaki Island. Both of these mountains are easy to climb—you can make it to the top of them both in a day, and still have time to hit the beach.\nMt. Omoto overlooks Yonehara Beach in the north of the island. It's a little over 500 meters high and takes between 60 and 90 minutes to climb. When you get to the top, you'll be rewarded with a fabulous view of the whole island, the coral reefs, and the surrounding islands.\nMt. Nosoko is located a little way up the Hirakubo Peninsula, in the northeast of the island, and while it is not as high and does not offer quite an expansive view, it is still worth the trek.\nIt doesn't take much time to climb and makes for an easygoing experience. The view from the top is of the Hirakubo Peninsula, and the coastline to the west, with the whole island, spread out behind—a spectacular view in its own right."}

Explore on foot or by bike and find peace of mind on Miyako Island.\n### Don't Miss\n- Sparkling beaches and emerald sea\n- The lighthouse at Higashi-Hennazaki\n- The botanical garden, home to more than 1,600 types of plants and trees\n## How to Get There\nThe only way to get to Miyako Island is by plane.\nMiyako Airport has direct flights from Tokyo's Haneda Airport, Osaka's Kansai Airport, Nagoya Centrair International Airport, Naha Airport on Okinawa Main Island, Ishigaki, and Tarama.\nFor getting around the island, some hotels organize shuttle buses for their guests, but the local bus service is not easy to access. The best way to get around is by rented car or taxi. It's possible to drive around the whole island in three to four hour. You can also find bicycles and scooters for rent.\n### Quick Facts\nThere are nine inhabited islands that make up the Miyako Islands\nMiyako Island, the biggest, is almost as close to Taiwan as it is to Okinawa itself\n### White sand beaches and coral reefs\nMiyako Island is the fourth largest of the Okinawan islands. Most of the island's population is to be found in the north coast town of Hirara.\nThe island is surrounded by coral reefs and an emerald sea. The southern coast is mainly made up of cliffs but you'll find many white sandy beaches to the north, east, and west.\nThere are four islands connected to Miyako Island by bridge—Irabu Island to the west, and Shimoji, Kurima, and Ikema islands to the north. Each boasts miles of white sandy beaches and clear blue water.\nCape Higashi-Hennazaki on the southeast coast\n### Exploring the interior of Miyako Island\nThe sun-drenched beaches are certainly the main attraction for visitors to Miyako Island, but if you take the time to explore, you'll find plenty more to spark your interest.\nHigashi-Hennazaki is the most southeastern point of Miyako Island. At the tip of the two-kilometer-long peninsula stands a handsome white lighthouse. From here, you have a magnificent view of the emerald Pacific Ocean.\nIn the center of Hirara near the port, you'll find the Tuyumya Grave. This is the shrine of Nakasone Tuyumya, the ruler of Miyako in the 16th century.\n### A taxing monument\nThere is a tropical botanical garden in Hirara with more than 1,600 varieties of plants and trees. It's a great place to spend a relaxing hour and enjoy the refreshments on offer.\nAlso, look out for the Nintozei-ishi, the Tax Stone. It stands 1.4 meters tall and in ancient times it was used by the tax collector. If you were taller than the stone, you were old enough to pay tax.\n### Things to do on Miyako Island\nIn addition to the gorgeous beaches, there are many activities to enjoy. Snorkeling and diving in the coral reefs is extremely popular. In recent years, swimming with sea turtles while snorkeling has gained traction.\nActivities you can enjoy here include golf, cycling and fishing. Fishing is particularly celebrated because of the variety and quantity of fish that you can catch.\nThe seafood of Miyako Island is extremely famous, including its sashimi. The island's tradition is to eat sashimi with hot \"shima pepper\" in the soy sauce."}

The city of Naha boasts an ancient castle, a vibrant shopping street, and many other attractions that make it well worth a visit.\nNaha is by far the biggest city in Okinawa, home to around 21 percent of the main island's residents. It is also home to Okinawa's only public rail system, and the Okinawa Urban Monorail (Yui Rail) provides an easy route through the city to the old capital of Shuri.\n### Don't Miss\n- Shuri Castle (currently being restored)\n- Kokusai-dori, Naha's main shopping and entertainment street\n- Naminouegu Shrine, the first shrine of the Ryukyu Kingdom\n## How to Get There\nMost Okinawa adventures starts here. Naha Airport is the gateway to all of the Okinawa islands. The domestic airport welcomes planes from dozens of locations across Japan, with budget airlines catering for the traveler on a shoestring budget.\nThe city of Naha is just a 15-minute drive from the airport or a few stops on the monorail.\n### Quick Facts\nOkinawa is made up of hundreds of islands, but the main island is bigger than all the others put together\nNaha has a population of 300,000\nThe prefectural government was established in Naha in 1879 with the abolition of feudal domains\nShuri is now a part of the modern city of Naha\n### Getting around Naha and the main island\nThe Okinawa Urban Monorail (Yui Rail) is a convenient way to get from the airport to the city center and to Shuri.\nThere are a wide variety of bus routes, and express buses are also available for access to destinations outside of Naha City. Route and operation information can be found on the English website. Taxis offer a comfortable and private way to get around.\nCar rentals are readily available at the airport and at outlets in the city center. It may be more economical than taking a taxi depending on the distance and time to your destination.\n### Planning when to go\nOkinawa has a sub-tropical climate, and it can be very hot in the summer months, so be sure to drink plenty of water and take UV protection from March to October. Travel plans should be made cautiously during the rainy season from late May to early June, and in September when typhoons frequently hit islands.\nSpring and autumn are the ideal months if you want to take in the sun, sea, and beaches, but it's best to avoid Golden Week, the prime holiday season for vacationing Japanese, which is in the first week of May.\n### The Ryukyu Kingdom\nOkinawa is one of 47 prefectures that make up Japan, but has not always been so. Okinawa, or the Ryukyu Kingdom as it was then known, was an independent kingdom until 1609, when it came under the rule of Satsuma, a province in southern Japan.\nCommodore Matthew Perry docked in Naha Port in 1852 before his historic arrival in Edo (now Tokyo) the following year, when Japan opened up to the world after centuries of isolation.\nNaha became the capital in 1879, and it later absorbed the old capital, Shuri. But it was always the center of trading activity on the island. The port of Naha was trading with Korea and mainland Japan from at least the 11th century.\nThe islands only became part of Japan in 1879. After World War II the islands were occupied by the United States, and were only returned to Japan in 1972.\n### Intriguing gardens foreign and royal\nThe Kingdom of Ryukyu was once a vassal state of the Ming Dynasty, and China's influence on this region of Japan is undeniable. Fukushuen, a garden in Naha, is a manifestation of that power. All of the materials used to build it came from Fuzhou, as did its designers. The design and visual and aural effects are all subtly different from those of a Japanese garden.\nNot far from Shuri Castle is one of the Ryukyu Kingdom royal family's favorite retreats, Shikinaen Royal Garden. This forested retreat has a large circular pond with several islands, stone bridges, a wooden palace, an observatory, a banana plantation and a freshwater spring. Foreign dignitaries and other high-ranking guests came here regularly.\n### Recreating the past\nThere's plenty for you to see and do in Naha. It's a vibrant city with an active nightlife, most of it centered around Kokusai-dori, or International Street, which runs for almost two kilometers (1 mile) through the heart of Naha.\nYou'll discover bustling covered arcades leading off Kokusai-dori with stalls of local produce and handicrafts, and street performers on traffic-free Sundays.\nThe monorail can take you to Shuri, the former capital. Shuri Castle was the palace of the Ryukyu Kingdom from the 15th century until it came under Japanese rule in the 19th century.\nShuri Castle has burned down five times in the past but has been rebuilt each time. In 2019 the castle was destroyed by a fire. It is currently being rebuilt, with the reconstruction set to be completed in 2025. Visitors to the area now can see and hear the rebuilding process.\nBe sure you don't miss out on a visit to Naminouegu Shrine, which has been a sacred place in the religion of the Ryukyu Islands since it was first built long ago. It was burned down in WWII but restored to its original splendor in the 1990s. The shrine is a 15-minute walk from the Asahibashi monorail stop."}

The stunning blue of the ocean around these islands is so distinctive it has its own shade named for it—Kerama blue. Most of the Kerama Islands are uninhabited, with the most popular destinations being Tokashiki, Zamami, and Aka.\n### Don't Miss\n- Some of the best sandy beaches in Okinawa\n- Great diving and snorkeling for all levels\n- The humpback whales in the winter\n## How to Get There\nAccess the islands by ferry from Naha.\nThere are high-speed ferries from Tomari Port in Naha to three of the Kerama Islands: to Tokashiki Island (2-3 trips a day, taking about 40 minutes), Zamami Island (2 trips, 50-70 minutes), and Aka Island (1-2 trips, 50 minutes).\nFrom there, it is possible to island-hop by ferry.\n### Quick Facts\nThere are more than 20 islands in the Kerama archipelago\nOnly four of the islands are inhabited\nTokashiki Island is the largest of the Kerama islands\n### Turtles of Tokashiki\nTokashiki Island is the largest of the Kerama Islands, with Tokashiki Village and port on the northeast coast, and Aharen Village and port on the southwest coast. Ferries from Naha will bring you into Tokashiki Port, but you'll probably want to make your way to the other side of the island, to Aharen Beach and Tokashiku Beach.\n### Super snorkeling\nThere are many excellent beaches on the island, but these two have the best snorkeling locations, as well as the best facilities for tourists. The marine life here is exceptional, and the waters are home to a large number of sea turtles.\n### Make observations\nAharen is the larger of the two, and there are a number of tour companies which offer shuttle buses to the ports. Located next to the beach, the Kubandaki Observatory gives you a magnificent view of the islands and coastline.\n### Hit the beach, trek the trails\nTokashiku Beach is smaller, with fewer diving spots, but it is ideal for swimming and sunbathing. The area around Tokashiku Beach is made up of forested hills, and there are some excellent hiking trails and observation points.\n### Take it in your stride\nAlthough it is the second largest of the Kerama Islands, Zamami Island is small enough to be able to walk from the port to its two finest beaches in 20 minutes.\n### Best beaches\nAs with all of these islands, there are plenty of fine hiking trails through the tree-clad hills, but it is the beaches that make Zamami Island such a popular destination.\n### Sub-aqua sights\nWalk east of Zamami Port for 20 minutes, and you will come to Furuzamami Beach. Walk west the same distance, and you arrive at Ama Beach. Both are beautiful beaches with good facilities, and a great range of companies offering diving tours rides in glass-bottomed boats, and diving equipment rental.\n### Shallow waters\nThe water at Ama Beach is shallower, making it more family friendly, but it means you have to swim out farther to see the coral and sea life.\n### Small is beautiful\nWhile there are around 260 permanent residents on Aka Island, that number is multiplied many times over by travelers in search of great beaches and unspoiled nature.\n### Deer me\nUnspoiled is the word, with Ryukyu sika deer running free. They even swim between the islands. These deer are a protected species.\n### Pedal power\nThe best beach on Aka is Nishibama Beach. It's a 20-minute walk from the port, but you can rent bicycles, cars, and scooters. If you're a keen cyclist, the best way to get around the island is by bike.\n### Beaches less visited\nThere is a bridge from Aka Island which takes you to Geruma and Fukaji islands. These are less popular destinations, but still worth visiting as they have fine beaches and plenty of Kerama blue.\n### Whale of a time\nBetween January and March, some other welcome guests arrive in the waters around the Kerama Islands—humpback whales. The whales feed in the waters of Alaska for most of the year and then swim down to the Kerama Islands to give birth and raise their calves in the warm waters.\n### Time for your close up\nPlan on two or three hours for a whale watching tour. You're almost certain to get a close-up view of these magnificent creatures. Measuring 15 meters long and with fins a third of their length, they're a majestic sight. If you're unlucky and don't spot any whales on the tour, you'll get a refund (there are periods when refunds are not applicable; the period varies by tour)."}
