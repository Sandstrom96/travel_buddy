Sample perfectly marbled Kobe beef and akashiyaki—the local take on takoyaki octopus balls.\n## How to Get There\nHyogo Prefecture’s two largest cities are Kobe and Himeji and are easily accessed by bullet train.\nTravel to and from Tokyo, Nagoya, Hiroshima and Fukuoka is an easy journey on the Tokaido-Sanyo Shinkansen to Shin-Kobe Station or Himeji Station. Hyogo is a short ride on commuter rail from Osaka and Kyoto. For access by air, Kobe is about an hour from Kansai International Airport, while Kobe Airport handles domestic flights. If you're traveling by car, the prefecture is well-linked by road.

In the months leading up to winter, hunters would bring home their tusked prizes and make a hot pot dish known as botan nabe that you can still enjoy in the region today.\n- Akashi Sea Bream\nThe sea bream flourishes in the waters off the coast of Akashi, and the ones caught here have an exceptional depth of flavor and a texture that is suited for both sashimi and grilling. Sea bream is a traditional dish at celebrations in Japan, so celebrate by trying it here.\n- Kobe Beef\nWithin Japan, \"Kobe beef\" refers to beef cattle from Tajima. It is characterized by its marbling, flavor and fat that has a melting point lower than human body temperature.\n- Kuromame\nTamba black beans, known as kuromame, are grown in the Kyoto area and used in several ways in local cuisine. That includes being mashed with sugar and used to make sweets, or roasted until crunchy and served as a snack alongside ice-cold beer.\n- Toyooka Willow Basketry\nWillow basketry in Toyooka has stood the test of time—it's been around for more than 1,000 years. Originally used for household baskets and bento boxes back in the 9th century, today these time-honored weaving techniques are used to make stylish overnight bags and handbags.\n- Banshu Miki Forged Blades\nCenturies ago, tragedy turned into opportunity—rebuilding the razed Miki Castle transformed this region into a bladesmithing center. Custom-crafted saws, knives, chisels and other tools hand-forged in Miki are used and treasured by carpenters and others across Japan.\n- Izushi Ware\nIzushi yaki porcelain dates back to the 18th century discovery of kaolin-rich clay in Izushi.

Early forms were stylized with natural ash glazes, while slip glazes were introduced later.\n## Seasonal Highlights\n- Spring\nDuring cherry blossom season, the prefecture turns pink and the area surrounding Himeji Castle is particularly breathtaking. Enjoy the Kobe Festival and witness the yearly mountain burnoff in the Tonomine Highlands.\n- Summer\nThe hotter months are a time for outdoor adventures and festivals. Head to the cooler climes of some of Hyogo’s mountains, or down to the beaches of Suma, Ieshima or Awaji Island for fun and fireworks.\n- Autumn\nAutumn in Hyogo means spectacular events such as the Nada Fighting Festival, Kobe Jazz Street and the Tamba Momiji Meguri (Maple Leaf Tour), as well as cool temperatures for the Kobe Marathon.\n- Winter\nThe cold winter months are perfect for a ski trip and onsen getaway, and the Kinosaki area is perfect for both."}

Throughout its history, Awaji Island has acted as a vital connection between Honshu and Shikoku. There is much history to be found here, including the world's longest suspension bridge and several wonderful beaches.\n### Quick Facts\n- Sumoto City is located at the center of Awaji Island\n- At almost four kilometers in length, the Akashi Kaikyo Bridge is the world's longest suspension bridge and connects Awaji with Kobe\n- Goshikigahama's name refers to the colorful shimmering pebbles lining the beach\n## How to Get There\nConnecting the city of Kobe and the city of Naruto by bridge, Awaji Island is best accessed by car. You can also reach the island via bus or ferry.\nBuses run between Kobe City, Kobe Airport and Sumoto City on the island of Awaji. There are no trains on the island, and aside from bus services, there is limited public transport on the island. It is possible to take the ferry connecting Akashi Port to Iwaya Port on the north of the island. To the south, the island is connected by suspension bridge to Naruto, Shikoku.\n### Sumoto City\nSumoto City is located in the center of Awaji Island. The city is home to a number of historic sites that pre-date modern Japanese history.\nSumoto Castle on Mt. Mikumayama is said to have been built in 1526 by the Ataka clan, who led the Awaji Suigun Navy. The castle changed owners several times before it was abandoned, but the ruins of the castle and its reconstructed castle tower remain on the mountain today.\n### The world's longest suspension bridge\nAt almost four kilometers in length, the Akashi Kaikyo Bridge is the world's longest suspension bridge. The bridge connects Kobe City to Awaji Island and continues to Shikoku as part of the Kobe-Awaji Naruto Expressway. The bridge has 1084 lights that are used for illuminations during times of national celebration or during certain holidays and other events, creating a spectacular light show.\n### A beach of colored pebbles\nGoshikihama is on the western coast of Awaji Island and offers fantastic views towards the blue waters of the Seto Inland Sea. The name Goshiki refers to the five colors of the beach's pebbles, which shine like gems at sunset. The western orientation of the Beach offers fantastic views of the sunset. Numerous other popular beaches are located along the coasts of Awaji Island.\n### The Naruto whirlpools\nOne of the island's most famous attractions is the Naruto Whirlpools, which form in the strait between Awaji Island and Shikoku. The pools form as the tides force water in and out of the strait and are observable from Onaruto Bridge, which crosses the strait. For a more up-close look, you can book a cruise from the port in Minami-Awaji.\n### Ando's architecture\nTwo buildings designed by the iconic Japanese architect Tadao Ando can be found on Awaji Island—the Water Temple and Awaji Yumebutai. The Water Temple is a temple belonging to the Omuro School of Shingon Buddhism. Awaji Yumebutai is a group of facilities, including an international conference center, famous for the 100 terraced flowerbeds arranged on the grounds."}

But that's not all the city offers, and there's plenty to enjoy within the city and the surrounding areas.\n### Don't Miss\n- Himeji Castle: Over 400 years old, this is one of Japan's most iconic castles\n- Engyoji Temple: Located on Mt. Shosha, this temple is a popular feature in period films about Japan\n## How to Get There\nHimeji is on the Tokaido-Sanyo Shinkansen Line and is well connected to Tokyo. The JR Rail Pass covers this trip.\nThe bullet train from Tokyo Station to Himeji Station takes around three hours. Highway buses connect the city to Tokyo and several companies offer overnight bus services.\n### Himeji Castle\nHimeji Castle is both a Japanese National Treasure and a World Heritage site. Its status as one of Japan's 12 original castles and the fact it has survived four centuries without significant damage from war, earthquake or fire makes this castle a must-see. It is the finest surviving example of Japanese castle architecture, comprised of 83 buildings. The castle is called the Heron Castle because of its distinctive white plasterwork.\nOver 1,000 cherry trees can be found in the castle's grounds. Viewing those located in the castle's outer areas is free of charge, but if you'd like to see the blossoms in the inner castle you must pay the castle admission fee of around 1,000 yen. While the castle is arguably at its best during sakura season, it is also at its most crowded.\n### Kokoen Gardens\nKokoen is a large Japanese garden located next to Himeji Castle. It consists of nine separate, walled gardens designed in various styles of the Edo period. The gardens were opened in 1992 to commemorate the centenary of Himeji City and are built on the former site of the residence of Himeji Castle's lord.\n### Fashionable festivals\nFrom June 22 to June 24 each year, the area around Osakabe-jinja Shrine in the center of Himeji is transformed. Thousands of people arrive for the annual Himeji Yukata Festival, a celebration of the colorful “Yukata”, a traditional summer garment.\nThe Nada Kenka Matsuri is held every October at Matsubara Hachiman-jinja Shrine in Himeji. The festival is referred to as a fighting festival as participants slam portable shrines known as mikoshi into one another in a display of dominance.\n### Mountain temples\nMt. Shosha is at the northern edge of Himeji City and is home to Engyoji, a temple that has a history of over 1,000 years. The temple's lack of modern infrastructure means it is a common feature in period films; it appears in \"The Last Samurai.\" Despite its fringe location, the mountain is only 25 minutes away from the center of Himeji City by public transport.\nNot far away from Mt. Shosha is Mt. Seppiko, a collection of vertical rocky crags that attract rock climbers from across the Kansai region. The mountain is one of the Kinki 100 Famous Japanese mountains and has an excellent hiking trail to the top.\n### Museums for all ages\nHimeji has several museums which are well worth a visit such as the Himeji City Museum of Art, which hosts a permanent collection of a wide variety of Japanese and foreign artworks. Another popular museum is the Japan Toy Museum, which has a collection of over 90,000 items collected from Japan and around the world.\n### Nearby islands\nIeshima is a collection of 44 islands just off the coast of Himeji City in the Seto Inland Sea. Of the islands, just four are large enough to be inhabited, and of these, Ieshima is the largest.\nThe Ieshima Jukkei is a collection of ten scenic spots that can be found across the islands. Spots include the site of old castle ruins on Ieshima. The islands can be accessed by ferry from Himeji Port."}

There are also multiple ANA and Skymark Airlines flights between Tokyo's Haneda Airport and Kobe Airport. The cheapest way to get to Kobe is by overnight bus. There are a number of companies that offer the eight to nine-hour journey from Tokyo to the wider Osaka area, with prices varying from around 5,000 to 8,500 yen each way.\n### Quick Facts\nKobe is home to one of Japan's three Chinatown districts, Nankinmachi\nYou can eat world-famous Kobe beef\nIn 1995, the city was devastated by the Great Hanshin Earthquake\n### Home of the famous beef\nIf there's one dish that represents the city, it has to be Kobe beef. Coming from locally bred and raised Tajima cattle, this marbled, tender, and flavor-rich beef is internationally recognized and revered.\nThough there are a number of theories as to how the area produces such great beef, such as the cattle are massaged and given beer, this isn't actually the case. Instead, Kobe beef must meet a strict set of standards to ensure only the highest grade of beef is given the Kobe stamp of approval.\nThe most common way to enjoy Kobe beef here in the city is, of course, the classic steak. You can also try shabu shabu, where thin slices of meat are quickly dipped in boiling broth, or try sukiyaki, which is a hotpot style of cooking.\n### Checking out the night sights\nKobe's central location between the mountains and the sea offers you an eclectic collection of sightseeing and day trip opportunities.\nIf you are interested in getting a different perspective on the city, you can scale Kobe Port Tower, a 108-meter-high observation tower located on the city's waterfront between the Kobe Harborland entertainment and shopping district and Meriken Park. You can also take in what many consider Japan's best nighttime view by swinging up the Kobe-Nunobiki Ropeway, which scales the side of the Rokko mountain chain, to a breathtaking panorama of the city lights at night.\nFor a completely different view of the city, there's also lunch and dinner cruises that launch from Nakatottei Chuo Terminal on the bay.\n### Scenic walks and seaside parks\nKobe also boasts a number of impressive parks and waterfront hotspots. Check out the famous Sorakuen Garden, a traditional Japanese landscape garden in the middle of the city, or consider a 40-minute hike from Shin-Kobe Station up to the Kobe Nunobiki Herb Garden, passing Nunobiki Falls along the way.\n### Chinatown\nKobe is home to Nankinmachi, one of Japan's three main Chinatown districts, which offers plenty of street food and bubble tea. It is about a 5-minute walk from JR Motomachi Station.\n### Day trips\nThe city is also perfectly located for day trips to Osaka and beyond. Scale Mt. Rokko's 931-meter-tall peak to get a panoramic view of both Kobe and neighboring Osaka at once. Alternatively, visit Arima Onsen—one of Japan's oldest hot spring towns—to soak in the natural and healing waters.\n### The earthquake\nIn 1995, the city was devastated by the Great Hanshin Earthquake—also known as the Kobe Earthquake—which led to the death of 6,434 people. It also reportedly caused injury to more than 43,000 people and destroyed 100,000 homes. This magnitude 7.3 earthquake, and the destruction it left in its wake, has since shaped the city's identity.\nNumerous events and memorials are hosted across the city to remind visitors of what the city overcame and how to prevent any major future devastation. In 2002, the Kobe Earthquake Memorial Museum was opened to commemorate those lost in the tragedy and to educate about earthquake and disaster preparedness."}

Many aspects of Japanese culture originate from Kyoto and are deeply rooted in the lives of residents to this day. Tradition lives on through “machiya,” traditional wooden townhouses where residents spend modern lives today, yearly events unique to Kyoto like the famous Gion Matsuri, the culture of Kyoto's Hanamachi district where geisha live and work, and through Jizo statues (statues made of clay, bronze or stone that represent the guardian deity of children and travelers) found throughout the city. Kyoto's tradition adds color to everyday life through Japanese food – which is generally healthy and has good nutritional balance – as well as an appreciation for tea, and flower arrangements placed tastefully in open spaces. By experiencing this kaleidoscopic culture firsthand, travelers can enjoy a deeper perspective on Kyoto and its history.\nTo enjoy the charms that Kyoto has to offer, it's recommended to make use of less busy times to visit shrines – early in the morning, or late at night when they're lit up, for example. Additionally, you can divide Kyoto into a number of areas, complete with their own unique beauty and charm. In central Kyoto, there are a number of historic buildings and unforgettable pristine old townscapes for travelers to visit.\nThere are also a number of hidden gems unique to each region outside of central Kyoto. In northern Kyoto, the boundless natural beauty of the Keihoku and Miyama areas are complemented by a traditional Japanese countryside landscape. Further north in the region near the Sea of Japan, travelers can enjoy Amanohashidate's sandbar and Ine's boathouses. In southern Kyoto, visitors can taste traditional sake from Fushimi, which is one of Japan's three major sake brewery locations, as well as enjoy Japanese tea from Uji. To the west, visitors can experience the charm of Kyoto's bamboo forests and rural landscapes, as well as temples and shrines with deep histories in the Nishiyama Area. Unparalleled hidden gems await you outside of central Kyoto!\nWhen visiting Kyoto, it's best to keep in mind that many local residents call this ancient city home. To enjoy your trip to the fullest, please show consideration to local communities and mind your manners to help preserve Kyoto's culture and keep tourism sustainable moving forward.\nDue to Kyoto's increasing popularity, the city sometimes has an excessive concentration of tourists during particular times and seasons, or in certain areas – making life difficult for locals, and potentially damaging to natural environments.\nTo experience the quiet and serene beauty of Kyoto, make use of the Kyoto Travel Congestion Forecast map to check when popular spots are crowded, including live cameras to check how busy places are in real time. It's also recommended to visit popular temples in the early morning when they open, or to explore the other compelling areas outside of central Kyoto to help reduce crowds. In addition, taking advantage of Japan's trains and buses is a convenient way to get around the city. There are also a number of coin lockers and luggage storage facilities around rail stations that visitors can use. By leaving your luggage at these storage facilities, not only does it make it possible to enjoy Kyoto without needing to carry luggage around town, but it also helps reduce congestion on public transportation and makes space for more people to ride.\nWhen in the Gion and Higashiyama areas, you might see a “geiko” (geisha in Kyoto's dialect) or “maiko” (geisha in training) pass by. While you may be tempted to ask them for a photo, please refrain from stopping them and asking them for photos or touching their clothes since these lovely ladies are often in a hurry to get to their next appointment. If you'd like to get the chance to talk to a maiko or take pictures with them, consider booking a maiko experience or activity at Gion Corner instead. At Nishiki Market, while you may be tempted to enjoy your purchase while you explore the market, please eat any food at the store where it was purchased and dispose of the trash on site. As littering is strictly prohibited, it might be smart to bring a plastic bag for trash in case you can't find a trashcan nearby.\nThroughout Kyoto, be aware that smoking on the street is strictly prohibited, and there are penalties for smoking outside designated areas in the city center, including the Kiyomizu and Gion areas and around Kyoto Station. If you need to smoke, please find a designated smoking area first or you may be fined for smoking outdoors. Finally, please do not trespass onto private property, or interfere with residents' private lives, especially around Gion and the Ine boathouses. Local residents are sharing their community with visitors, so please show consideration to these communities and respect their spaces and property. (Click here for a message from Southern Gion)\n## How to Get There\nKyoto, a prime destination for most travelers, is easily accessible from Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, Fukuoka and other major cities via the Tokaido-Sanyo Shinkansen.\nThe nearest airports are Itami and Kansai International, both in Osaka Prefecture, and are located between 1 hour and 1.5 hours away, respectively.\nThanks to Kyoto Prefecture's vast transportation network, it's easy to uncover Kyoto's hidden charms, or visit the Another Kyoto area. The Ohara, Takao and Northern Kyoto areas are easily accessed by bus from Kyoto Station, and those looking to get to Miyama can take a bus from the Northern Kyoto area. The Yamashina Ward, Fushimi and Uji areas, as well as western Kyoto areas, are all accessible by train. To reach the Amanohashidate and Miyama areas, travelers will need to take the JR San'in Honsen Line, then change trains or use a bus, so it's recommended to plan in advance if you'd like to visit these areas.\n### Don’t Miss\n- Kyoto’s grand shrines, ancient castles and historical streets\n- Ohara’s crisp mountain air, stunning autumn foliage and symbolic gardens\n- Kyoto’s traditional Japanese inns, an essential convergence of Japanese tradition and culture\n- Kyoto cuisine, which perfectly encapsulates the Japanese spirit and art of food preparation\n- The four alternative views of Kyoto: Kyoto by the Sea, Woodland Kyoto, Tea Country Kyoto and Kyoto Otokuni Bamboo Groves\n## Explore Kyoto by Area\n- \\\\\nAround Kyoto Station & Southern Kyoto\n- \\\\\nGion & Higashiyama\n- \\\\\nCentral Kyoto\n- \\\\\nTakagamine & Murasakino\n- \\\\\nSagano & Arashiyama\n- \\\\\nOhara\n- \\\\\nKurama & Kifune\n- \\\\\nAnother Kyoto\n## Trending Attractions in Kyoto\n- gion & higashiyamagion & higashiyama\\\\\nKiyomizudera Temple\n- Shogunzuka Seiryuden Temple\\\\\nShogunzuka Seiryuden Temple\n- Kennin-ji\\\\\nKenninji Temple\n- Murin-an\\\\\nMurin-an Garden\n- Nishiki Market\\\\\nNishiki Market\n## Local Specialties\n- Yudofu\nYudofu, literally \"hot-water tofu\", is arguably the best way to enjoy high-quality, freshly made tofu. Tofu is warmed through in a simple broth made of water and kombu, and simple condiments are served alongside. Kyoto is the place to enjoy this, as it is the epicenter of Buddhist cuisine, in which yudofu features heavily.\n- Kyo-Gashi\nKyo-gashi are a type of wagashi, or traditional Japanese sweet. Kyo-gashi are beautiful, colorful and symbolic confections, custom-made for different occasions, so no Kyo-gashi will ever be exactly the same as another.\n- Kyo-Yasai\nBefore modern transportation was available, farmers grew only the vegetables most suited to the regions they farmed in. Kyo-yasai are vegetables traditionally grown in Kyoto for centuries, and they play an important role in modern Kyoto cuisine.\n- Uji Tea\nGreen tea from Uji is among the oldest and most highly regarded teas in Japan. You'll find it in tiny soba restaurants and temple gardens and many places in between. There are a variety of ways to enjoy green tea while in Uji.\n- Kyoto Kiyomizu Ware\nHandmade ceramics and porcelain made in Kyoto are known as kyo yaki or Kiyomizu yaki and are characterized by their gorgeous elegance made with advanced pottery techniques. This craft evolved alongside other sophisticated pastimes in Kyoto, including the tea ceremony and flower arranging.\n- Kyoto Dyed Silk\nInvented in the late 17th century, kyo yuzen is a dyeing technique distinguished by vivid colors, subtle gradations, complex patterns and precision linework. Traditional Japanese painting-like patterns are expressed in the textile design.\n- Nishijin Textiles\nNishijin ori silk textiles originate in Nishijin, the garment district of Kyoto. Exquisitely decorated brocades have been handwoven here for centuries, and feature gorgeous patterns utilizing multi-colored yarn-dyed threads. Treated with care, these garments can last a lifetime.\n- Kyoto Folding Fans\nFashioned out of bamboo, the kyo sensu is a folding fan decorated with handmade Japanese paper or silk on thin wooden strips, traditionally cypress. These artful accessories are used at ceremonies, festivals and Noh performances.\n## Seasonal Highlights\n- Spring\nLate April to May is the time to view late-blooming cherry blossoms, yaezakura (double-flowered cherry blossoms) and the fresh green maple leaves in shrine and temple gardens.\n- Summer\nHighlights of the hottest season include riverside dining, cormorant fishing performances, beach excursions, the month-long Gion Festival, and fire displays to honor the spirits of ancestors.\n- Autumn\nKyoto’s autumn foliage attracts visitors from the world over. Harvest moon festivals are another autumn highlight. The cool temperatures are perfect for hiking at Mt. Ponpon and Mt. Atago.\n- Winter\nKabuki’s biggest stars come to perform, plum blossoms emerge after the snows, and countryside onsen offer plenty of warmth."}

Kyoto's culture was created by bringing together different materials and techniques from the surrounding environments. For example, vegetables used in Kyoto cuisine are procured from forests like Kameoka City, while the tea leaves used to make the city's famous green tea and matcha are grown in southern Kyoto, and is a specialty of areas like Uji City and Wazuka Town. Travelers to Japan looking to experience the profound charm of Kyoto will want to explore the four areas we've listed as “Another Kyoto” – Kyoto by the Sea, Woodland Kyoto, Kyoto Tea Country and Kyoto Otokuni Bamboo Grove.\n### Don't Miss\n- Take a leisurely stroll along the Sea of Japan on Amanohashidate's pine forest and sandbar in Miyazu Bay and experience Kyoto by the sea\n- Embark on a riverboat ride down the Hozu River in Kameoka City\n- Deepen your appreciation for Japanese tea and savor matcha in many forms in Uji City\n- Enjoy an idyllic walk amongst the bamboo trees in Muko City\n## How to Get There\nTravelers looking to explore Kyoto by the Sea can start their journey at Amanohashidate Station, which is about 130 minutes away from Kyoto Station.

Also in the Miyazu region, visitors will find Nariaiji Temple, one of the 33 temples visited along the Kansai Kannon Pilgrimage route. The serene village of Ine includes around 230 “ funaya” (boat houses) sitting right on the water, painting a picturesque scene. Visitors seeking sandy beaches and ocean waves can explore the shallow and tranquil waters of Tomari Beach in Ine, or experience the enchanting beauty of Yuhigaura Beach in the Kyotango region, complete with a driftwood swing and breathtaking sunsets.

Uji City, home to Byodoin Temple and the Uji Bridge, was the location of many aristocratic vacation homes since ancient times. As a result, the culture and industry of the region developed in line with the tastes of the upper class. Visitors to Uji City can deepen their appreciation for all things matcha and green tea, from traditional matcha soba and “cha-dango” (a sweet dumpling flavored with matcha) to contemporary delights such as matcha ice cream and matcha beer. Some shops in the area offer visitors the chance to grind their own matcha and enjoy a small tea ceremony using the freshly ground powder. For visitors interested in visiting a green tea farm, Wazuka is home to several ideal locations. In addition to being able to partake in tea picking experiences depending on the season, visitors can learn about different types of tea and their agricultural production cycles.\n### Kyoto Otokuni Bamboo Groves\nThe Kyoto Otokuni Bamboo Grove area, spread across Muko City, Nagaokakyo City and Oyamazaki Town in western Kyoto, is known for its beautiful bamboo groves and production of high-quality bamboo shoots. Take-no-Michi (“The Bamboo Path”) in Muko City is a hidden gem that gives visitors an intimate experience amongst towering bamboo. Roughly five times the size of Arashiyama and spanning a total of 1.8 kilometers, Take-no-Michi's bamboo path is lined with eight different kinds of bamboo hedges. Here, visitors can enjoy a stroll through an enchanting bamboo forest without worrying about crowds.\nThere's certainly more to Kyoto Otokuni Bamboo Groves than just admiring the bamboo. Visitors can enjoy sweets or kaiseki cuisine featuring bamboo shoots, or try their hand at making traditional bamboo crafts like tea scoops and bamboo baskets."}

It is now home to some of Japan's most popular attractions. Many of these attractions, including Kyoto Gosho and Nijo Castle, are located right in the heart of the city. You can spend several hours exploring the center of Kyoto and see some of Japan's most iconic heritage sites.\n©Nijo Castle Office\n### Don't Miss\n- The grand, feudal-era Nijo Castle\n- Kyoto Gosho and the spacious park that surrounds it\n- Shimogamo-jinja Shrine, one of Kyoto's oldest shrines\n- The traditional atmosphere of the Nishijin Textile District\n## How to Get There\nCentral Kyoto is easily accessed by train or bus from Kyoto Station.\nMost of Central Kyoto is accessed conveniently by the Kyoto Municipal Subway Karasuma Line or the private railway Keihan Line from Kyoto Station. To visit Kyoto Gosho, Kyoto Goen and Sento Gosho parks from Kyoto Station, take the Karasuma Line to Marutamachi or Imadegawa Station. To get to Nijo Castle from Kyoto Station, take the Karasuma Line to Karasuma-Oike Station. Switch to the Kyoto Municipal Subway Tozai Line and get off at Nijo-jo-mae Station. Shimogamo-jinja Shrine is on the Keihan Line toward Demachiyanagi Station. It's a 10-minute walk from there. The Nishijin District is best accessed by bus. From Kyoto Station, take the number 9 bus to Horikawa Imadegawa bus stop.\n©Nijo Castle Office\n### A show of power at Nijo Castle\nThe first Tokugawa shogun, Ieyasu, had this extravagant complex built in 1603. He intentionally built close to the Imperial Palace as an expression of his power, and to protect the Emperor.\nThe elaborate gilded architectural detail of Nijo Castle is in stark contrast to the bare minimalism of the Imperial Palace; the castle is covered in intricate wood carvings and extravagantly painted panels, and features double moats and a high wall for protection. One fascinating feature is the \"nightingale\" floors, named for the birdlike sound they emit when you walk across them. This was an ancient security system, alerting guards to intruders.\nThe huge palace complex is comprised of five main buildings, all with numerous chambers. You can peek your head into these and see the impressive screen paintings by famed artists Kano Tanyu and Naonobu. The grounds contain a spectacular example of a traditional Japanese landscape garden as well as an ornamental plum orchard and many maples that turn brilliant hues in autumn.\n©Nijo Castle Office\n### The regal Kyoto Gosho\nKyoto Gosho is the former residence of the Japanese imperial family. It has been vacant since 1868 when the capital moved from Kyoto to Tokyo.\nThe palace you see today is surrounded by a high wall on all sides and within its grounds the historic architecture of Kyoto can be seen.\nGuided tours and access to the interiors of the buildings can be applied for at the Imperial Household Office inside the Imperial Palace Park, or directly in front of the palace buildings.\n### Kyoto Gyoen and Sento Gosho\nThe Imperial Palace and the Sento Gosho palace grounds are both located within the grounds of Kyoto Gyoen.\nDuring the Edo period (1603-1867), emperors came to Sento Gosho to relax. Only two buildings remain, but the garden is splendid in its own right. It features a walled garden dotted with serene ponds. Well-trodden pathways meander past magnificent trees and an array of impressive plants and flowers. Sento Gosho is accessible only by guided tour. You can apply for the tour in front of the palace.\nThe Kyoto State Guest House is also open to the public and is to the east of the Gosho.\nKyoto's answer to New York's Central Park, Kyoto Gyoen is an oasis within the city and is perfect for an afternoon stroll. It's a great spot to people-watch, as locals come here to jog or have a picnic. No application is necessary to enter Kyoto Gyoen, which surrounds Kyoto's Imperial Palace.\nKyoto Gyoen has some good flora to see. A plum grove blooms in early March and a grove of weeping cherry trees bloom a bit earlier in the spring.\n### Warding off evil at Shimogamo-jinja\nDating back to the sixth century, Shimogamo-jinja Shrine is one of Japan's oldest and most important shrines and is a designated UNESCO World Heritage site. Together with Kamigamo-jinja Shrine, it is one-half of the pair of Kamo Shrines built to protect Kyoto from evil.\nShimogamo-jinja is one of Kyoto's most sophisticated shrines, with splendidly detailed architecture. The complex includes many small shrines in a beautiful setting in the northeastern part of Central Kyoto, tucked within a large forest that contains 600-year-old trees. Many events are held at Shimogawa-jinja, most importantly the Aoi Matsuri held in May, one of Kyoto's three great festivals.\n### Traditional textiles in Nishijin District\nThe traditional textile district of Kyoto, Nishijin, is in the northwest of central Kyoto. Come here to learn about the history of Japanese textiles and to wander the historic streets lined with old wooden houses, or machiya, and dotted with small temples.\nVisit the Nishijin Textile Center to learn more about the ancient art of weaving. A workshop-museum hybrid, it's a great way to see some truly remarkable kimono first-hand.\nThe center also features live weaving demonstrations and a gallery of extravagant kimono from long ago.\nHands-on activities include weaving classes and the chance to dress up in a kimono and get your photo taken and/or stroll the streets of Kyoto in style.\nYou can also visit the Orinasukan, a somewhat smaller, quieter museum. Here you can find exhibits on the history of the area as well as live weaving demonstrations. There are some truly remarkable Japanese textiles on display, including some intricate Noh theater costumes."}

The area is also home to several of the city's kagai, or geisha districts.\n### Don't Miss\n- Spotting an elusive geisha, called geiko in Kyoto\n- Taking a leisurely morning stroll down the Philosopher's Path\n- Scouring the quaint shops in the Gojo area for locally-made ceramics and other crafts\n- Observing the city from the incredible wooden stage at Kiyomizu-dera Temple\n## How to Get There\nGion and Higashiyama cover a wide area that is now the heart and soul of Kyoto. It is easily accessed by public transportation. Within the district, most sites are a leisurely walk away.\nFrom Kyoto Station take the no. 5 or 100 bus for Silver Pavilion (Ginkakuji Temple) and the northern end of the Philosopher's Path. This journey takes about 40 minutes. Take the no. 100 and 206 buses for Kiyomizu-michi, the nearest stop to Kiyomizu-dera Temple. This journey takes about 20 minutes.\nGion-Shijo and Kiyomizu-Gojo stations on the Keihan Line offer easy access to Shijo and Gojo streets. You can Gion and Kiyomizu within 15 minutes by walking eastwards along these streets.\nKiyomizu-dera\n### The Silver Pavilion—the center of Higashiyama culture\nKyoto experienced a cultural renaissance under the 15th century shogun Yoshimasa, who built the exquisite Ginkakuji Temple, nicknamed the Silver Pavilion (though never actually covered in silver) and now a UNESCO World Heritage site. Here the traditional arts, from tea to ikebana flower arranging, flourished under his patronage. The temple garden, which was completed after Yoshimasa's death in 1490, is famous for its moss and autumn colors, though it is gorgeous the year round.\nGinkaku-ji, The Silver Pavillion\n### Enjoy a contemplative stroll along the Philosopher's Path\nRunning along the foot of the Eastern Hills is a cherry tree-lined canal and trail, known today as the Philosopher's Path. There are some nice little craft shops and cafes to relax at along the way. While usually tranquil, at the peak of the cherry blossoms season this route can be very crowded, so it is best to start early during that time of year.\nSummer greenery along the Philosopher's Path\nFollow the Philosopher's Path southbound for about 30 minutes from Silver Pavilion (Ginkakuji Temple), and you will pass numerous temples including Eikando, a prime autumn foliage-viewing spot, before reaching the massive Nanzenji Temple complex. This was once the country's most important temple, and you may well recognize the enormous Sanmon Gate from the Hollywood blockbuster \"Lost in Translation.\" The sub temple of Tenju-an is also highly recommended. The Murin-an gardens are a calm and tranquil place not too far away.\nNanzenji Temple\n### Discover the old and new of Gion\nFurther south, towards Shijo Street, you begin to enter Gion. Here you can find the ochaya, wooden teahouses, that serve as the residences and reception venues for geisha, though some have been converted into high-end restaurants and bars that are open to the public.\nShinbashi Street is especially picturesque. Furumonzen and Shinmonzen streets close by are home to a cluster of antique shops.\nShijo Street itself is a lively and modern entertainment area, with abundant opportunities to shop for souvenirs and eat your fill of green tea-flavored sweets. Strolling through the Yasaka-jinja Shrine grounds on the far eastern end, you can continue on through the pleasant Maruyama Park to Chionin and Shorenin temples.\nKodaiji Temple is also easily accessible from here and holds interesting night-time exhibitions and light-up events through the year.\nIf you wish to continue your pursuit of geisha, follow Hanamikoji Street southbound to Gion Kobu Kaburenjo Theater. In normal circumstances visitors can also watch the maiko (apprentice geisha) perform, as well as other traditional Japanese arts.\nA stone's throw away is Kenninji Temple, the oldest Zen temple in Kyoto.\n### Shop for local crafts and ceramics in the Kiyomizu area\nThe Kiyomizu area is heaven for ceramics lovers and is host to numerous pottery shops.\nKawai Kanjiro Memorial House, the former residence of a mingei potter, is a hidden gem in the area.\nKiyomizudera Temple is a must-see, though prepare to walk uphill and brave crowds to reach it.\nGion and Higashiyama is a district filled with many of the sites and sights that are the very reason that people flock to Kyoto. You should expect to spend a whole day here, at least, or risk feeling rushed. Two days and an evening are recommended."}

Temples with mysterious origins, a mystical history, lush cedar forests, and an easy day hike are all at your fingertips.\n### Don't Miss\n- The mountain dwelling Kuramadera Temple\n- Up and over the mountain on the Kurama-Kibune hike\n## How to Get There\nThe Kurama area is accessible by train and bus from Kyoto Station.\nTake the Kyoto Municipal Karasuma Line to Kokusai Kaikan, and from the Kokusai Kaikan-mae bus stop take the Kyoto Bus No. 52 bound for Kurama Onsen. Get off at Kurama.\n### A mystical land\nMt. Kurama is known for being the birthplace of reiki, a holistic healing art started in the early 1900s and still practiced widely today. Mt. Kurama has a history steeped in mystical beliefs.\n### Protected by tengu\nIt is believed that tengu, mythical creatures from Japanese folklore, still haunt the area. Once believed to be evil, they are now seen as protectors of the natural world. Thought to be both kami and yokai—divine spirit and ghost—tengu are depicted with both human and bird-like characteristics.\nOutside of Kurama station you will be greeted by an enormous statue of Sojobo, king of the Tengu, said to have originated in Kurama.\n### The esoteric history of Kuramadera Temple\nKuramadera is the main temple of the area, sprawling down one side of Mt. Kurama.\nThe temple was founded in the eighth century, but its origins are mysterious. It is said that a monk traveled to Kurama after learning of its mystical powers in a dream. He built Kuramadera to harness the unique spiritual power of the area. Although it was controlled by various Buddhist sects throughout the ages, it is dedicated to esoteric beliefs and mountain worship today.\n### Hike or ride up to a grand view\nYou can pay 200 yen to take a short cable car up the mountain to reach the main building. If you'd like a more intimate look at the complex, you can hike up the mountain path.\nAt the top, the mountain is elevated, and buildings stand in a vast courtyard. The view of the mountains and valleys beyond is amazing.\n### The Kurama-Kibune hike\nPast the main hall, a trail continues up and over the mountain to Kibune on the opposite side of the mountain. The hike is lovely, and leads to a few smaller temples that are part of Kuramadera.\n### Exposed roots\nHalfway through the hike, you'll encounter a special grove of trees. Their roots are unable to penetrate the hard ground and have woven together in a mesmerizing pattern.\n### A satisfying journey\nIf you include the walk from the base of the temple, the hike to Kibune is 3.9 km and takes about two to three hours. It's not too difficult, and includes wooden steps and handrails in more difficult areas both ascending and descending the mountain. Come in August, when it's not as hot as the city, or autumn, when the trees are at their best.\n### Kifune-jinja Shrine and Kibune\nOnce in Kibune, you should continue your mountain pilgrimage and visit Kifune-jinja. It's hard to miss the entrance to Kifune-jinja: a long stone staircase lined with red lanterns. The sight is absolutely stunning in any season.\nThe shrine is dedicated to the god of water and features a special omikuji (fortune) that can be floated on the water. At first it appears blank, but once placed on the water of the shrine's fountain, your fortune magically appears.\n### Dine on kawadoko\nKibune is a fantastic area and worth a closer look. Local Kyoto people would come to Kibune to escape the heat of the city. It's known for the kawadoko, or decks, that are built over the Kibune river, and are a natural form of air-conditioning. During the summer, you can enjoy a traditional Japanese meal atop a kawadoko, a truly unique experience.\nThe Kurama area offers many more attractive places and events. Day trips are possible from downtown Kyoto, but an overnight stay may be a good option for hikers."}

In addition to its wonderful temples, it is a popular spot for autumn leaves, which burst into color about one week earlier than the rest of Kyoto, and for cherry blossoms and azaleas in the spring.\n### Don't Miss\n- Sanzenin, a temple with deep ties to the Imperial family\n- Jikkoin, a strong influence on Japan's musical traditions\n- Jakkoin, a nunnery since 1186\n## How to Get There\nThe Ohara Area is accessible from JR Kyoto Station by bus.\nFrom Kyoto Station, you can catch bus no. 17 to Ohara. It's a 40-minute ride to Ohara.\n### Enchanting origins\nOhara is known as the center of shomyo, a Buddhist chanting style associated with the Tendai sect of Buddhism. Shomyo was brought to the area by the monk Ennin (794-864), who had studied the technique in China, although it originated in India.\n### A little about Tendai Buddhism\nTendai Buddhism in Japan is based on a Chinese school of Buddhism of the same name. In Japan, Tendai Buddhism was arguably the most important and influential of the many schools of Buddhism. Its universal world view allowed for the reconciliation of Buddhist teachings and Shinto. In addition, most of the founders of new schools of Buddhism in Japan were originally trained in Tendai Buddhism. Tendai had very close ties with the Imperial family, and with the Tokugawa shogunate. The headquarters of Tendai is Enryakuji on Mt. Hiei in Kyoto.\n### A quaint village\nThe town of Ohara is charming, the locals are friendly, and you can find many small shops offering local specialties and crafts. There are a few ryokan, complete with onsen, available if you wish to prolong your stay in this tranquil mountainside village.\n### Sanzenin\nSanzenin Temple is the town's most famous site. A street of the town leads directly to it, tucked away in the eastern mountains.\nSurrounded by towering stone walls, Sanzenin is a large temple complex with many impressive buildings and beautiful gardens. The well-known monk Saicho (767-822), responsible for the founding of the Tendai sect of Buddhism, established the temple in the early Heian Period (794-1185).\nSanzenin is surrounded by many smaller temples, most belonging to the Tendai sect. A lovely walking trail through the mountains connects them, eventually leading to the scenic Otonashi Waterfall.\n### Jikkoin\nA short walk from Sanzenin is Jikkoin Temple. Originally the monk's quarters for nearby Shorin-in Temple, Jikkoin now stands alone as an impressive temple.\nThe guest hall features bells and other instruments used in Shomyo music.\n### Symbolic gardens\nJikkoin is known for its two gardens. Keishin-en Garden has a koi pond in which each of its natural features represents a different Buddhist symbol.\nBelow the temple is a stroll garden with a pond, tea house, stone lanterns and small stone pagodas. The garden is known for its autumn-blooming cherry trees, which afford visitors the unique opportunity of viewing cherry blossoms and autumn foliage together.\nThe temple is generally quiet, as few guests visit except in the fall. You can sit here and enjoy a cup of matcha with Japanese sweets, and bask in the serenity.\n### Jakko-in\nJakko-in Temple is also of the Tendai sect. Although it dates back more than a thousand years, the main hall was lost in 2000 to arson and rebuilt in 2005.\nJakko-in is known for its picturesque stairway leading to the front gate. Interestingly, this temple was also once a nunnery where a former empress studied.\nWhile here, visit the art gallery, which has an impressive collection of calligraphy scrolls and ancient Japanese paintings.\nOhara offers visitors a chance to see real rural Japan without an arduous trek. It makes for a peaceful and soothing day trip."}

Saihoji Temple next door is famous for its moss garden, resplendent with 120 types of beautiful moss (reservation required).\n### Japan's most precious imperial villa\nRakusai's main attraction is certainly Katsura Imperial Villa, a world-famous villa featuring a simple but functional architectural style. Several teahouses dot the grounds, interconnected by a foot path that winds through what many consider to be Japan's most beautiful garden. You can only explore the grounds as part of a guided tour."}

The famed Nishijin weaving district is still a thriving center of crafts, and is a great spot to immerse yourself in ancient Kyoto. Although not as well-known as the city's other places of worship, the temples in this area are famous for their connection to the arts.\n### Don't Miss\n- The quiet grounds of Murasakino's lesser-known temples\n- The grave of Tale of Genji author Murasaki Shikibu\n- The Omiya and Shinmachi shopping streets, not far from Daitokuji Temple\n## How to Get There\nThese districts are accessible by train and bus from Kyoto Station.\nFrom Kyoto Station, northern Kyoto (where Takagamine and Murasakino are located) is most easily accessed by train via the Kyoto Municipal Subway. Takagamine and Murasakino are a short walk west of Kita-Oji Subway Station on the Karasuma Line. Kita-Oji is just seven stops from Kyoto Station.\nMany buses stop in these districts. The bus may be more convenient if you are going from another less central location.\n### In the name of history\nTakagamine means \"Peak of the Hawk,\" and got its name because this area once served as the Imperial hunting grounds when falconry was a popular sport among the nobility.\nThe name of the neighboring district, Murasakino, has a similar genesis. Murasaki in Japanese means “purple,” and Murasaki Shikibu, author of The Tale of Genji—the world's oldest extant novel—is buried in the district. Murasakino remains a vibrant neighborhood of old shopping arcades and lively festivals.\n### The birthplace of warrior Zen\nDaitokuji Temple is the largest of Murasakino's many temples, with two dozen sub-temples within its vast grounds. As the center of the tea ceremony, the temple has a wealth of teahouses, Japanese gardens, graves of former warlords, famous fusuma (sliding door) paintings, and other historical sites and cultural assets.\n### Weaving a tale of textiles, history and culture\nThe Nishijin district offers you both the ambiance of ancient Kyoto and insights into the crafts and culture that the city is so well known for. At the Nishijin Textile Center and Orinasukan, for example, you can explore the realm of fine textiles. There are museums and galleries devoted to the weaving arts as well.\nThe Urasenke Chado Research Center is the place to learn about Japan's culture of tea, in the city that claims to be the heart of it all.\n### A microcosm of stone and sand\nDaitokuji's most popular sub-temple is Daisenin, whose gardens have inspired garden designers for centuries. This sub-temple offers weekend zazen meditation sessions for those who want to ponder life and the garden more deeply.\n### Ensuring security against illness\nDaitokuji Temple is Imamiya-jinja Shrine, where locals offer prayers for protection from epidemic diseases. The shrine hosts the Yasurai Festival in spring, which features a parade where red and black demons dance to the music of flutes and drums. According to legend, if you walk under the Furyu-gasa—an elegant umbrella adorned with flowers and grass for the festival—you'll stay healthy for the entire year.\n### A tale of two temples\nKoetsuji Temple in Takagamine was once the residence of Honami Koetsu, a very famous Japanese cultural giant, expert in calligraphy, ceramic art, gold lacquerware and the tea ceremony in the 17th century.\nNot far away is Genkoan, a temple built in the mid-14th century, famous for its square and round windows overlooking the gardens. The floorboards used for the ceiling of the temple's main hall have a dark history: when Fushimi Castle fell in 1600, the lord and his family committed suicide, leaving their bloodstains on the floorboards.\nBoth temples sit high on a rise above Kyoto, so their gardens offer fantastic views of the city below.\n### The art of the Korean Peninsula\nThe area's most unusual attraction is likely the Koryo Museum, a collection of 1,700 works of art from the Korean Peninsula assembled by a former pachinko and izakaya magnate. This is Japan's only museum dedicated to the art of the Korean Peninsula, and includes folk art, paintings, bronze works, pottery and furniture the founder collected from all over Japan."}

Many of these sites have cultivated flower gardens that enhance their surroundings. Nara Park is home to the famously tame deer wandering freely, and adjacent Todaiji Temple houses the world's largest bronze Buddha statue. Important pilgrimage routes run through the Mt. Yoshino area, a World Heritage site and stunning cherry blossom spot in the spring.\n## How to Get There\nYou can reach Nara easily from either Osaka or Kyoto, the key transit points for a visit to the prefecture. The nearest airports are Osaka International (Itami) Airport and Kansai International Airport, both located in Osaka Prefecture, approximately an hour and 15 minutes by bus and train.\nThe sights at Nara Park and Naramachi are accessible from both Nara Station and Kintetsu Nara Station. A bus will get you to the sites of Heijo Palace and Horyuji Temple.

Its ties to Japan's ancient past provide a sense of wonder, and it is a great place to discover by bicycle.\nThe sweeping scenery and rich history of the Asuka area are great if you enjoy being outdoors or examining art and artifacts. Large monoliths and carved stones are scattered across the area, and other objects have been gathered for the study of times long past.\n### Don't Miss\n- Mysterious stones and burial mounds\n- Asuka Historical Museum\n- A perfectly preserved Edo period (1603-1867) town\n## How to Get There\nAccess to Asuka Station is from either Kyoto Station or Nara Station. It takes around one hour from either of the two cities.\nFrom Kyoto Station, take the Kintetsu Kyoto Line to Kashihara-jingu-mae Station. Transfer there to Kintetsu Yoshino Line. Asuka Station is just four minutes away.\nFrom Nara Station, it is a short walk to Kintetsu Railways. Take the Kintetsu Yoshino Line to Kashihara-jingu-mae Station. Transfer there to Kintetsu Yoshino Line. Asuka Station is just four minutes away from there.\n### Ancient history preserved\nThe Asuka area contains the first temples, shrines, tombs, and stone monuments of Japan. Although it is not the most well-known of Japan's capitals, it was one of the first, serving as the political, artistic, and religious center of Japan during the 5th and 6th centuries.\nThis was a time of great change in Japan. It was here, in the Kashihara area, that the first emperor is thought to have taken the throne. During the Asuka period (538-710) Buddhism arrived from China, bringing with it many other cultural innovations. This period marked the first time that Japan functioned as a unified national state.\nAsuka's roots go even deeper than the historical era that bears its name, back to the Kofun, or Old Mound period (250-552). This era gets its name from the burial practice of large, key-shaped earthen mounds surrounded by moats.\n### Enter the tomb of an influential noble\nBurial mounds still dot the landscape in this area. Some of them are known to be graves of important figures from the region. One of these is known as Ishibutai Burial Mound, or the Stone Stage. Here you have the chance to go inside this massive structure and get a view of the stonework buried beneath the ground.\nTakamatsuzaka Kofun is probably the most famous of these burial mounds. No one knows exactly who was laid to rest in this tomb. During its first excavation in the 1970s, a colored mural was found. You can see a replica at Takamatsuzaka Mural Hall while the original is being studied and restored.\n### Visit mysterious stone structures\nThere are over 200 large stone figures in the area, many of which remain in their original locations. They can be toured by (rental) bicycle. Doing so is a great way to enjoy the rural scenery, which is accented in both spring and fall by wildflowers growing along the roads.\nThe artists that created these stones and their functions have been lost to history. Each stone takes a different shape and style. Looking at them, you can't help but wonder about the people who labored with primitive tools to create these sculptures that have outlived them by more than a millennium.\nSome of the structures you can see are a large stone in the shape of a turtle, called kameishi; a set of four stones carved into the shape of monkeys, called saruishi; and a set of stoneworks including the figures of a coin and a tortoise.\nThere are also more abstract symbols like the sake trough, or sakefuneishi, made of carved lines and pools in a flat, table-shaped rock.\n### Collections of art and artifacts\nThe Nara National Research Institute for Cultural Properties, or Asuka Historical Museum, strives to help people understand these distant times. It focuses on artifacts from the Asuka period.\nThe collection of the Archaeological Institute of Kashihara displays artifacts from even earlier times, ranging from prehistoric ages to the 3rd century AD.\n### The origins of Japanese Buddhism in a modest temple\nAsukadera is one of the oldest temples in Japan, first built around 596. The main buildings were moved to Nara City when the capital was relocated there. The current buildings were set in a nearby location between the 17th and 18th centuries. But this temple still has its original bronze statue of Buddha—the oldest in Japan.\n### An authentic Edo period town\nYou can find a slightly more recent history in Asuka, too. Imaicho, in Kashihara City, is home to the largest neighborhood of authentic Edo period (1603-1867) buildings in Japan. Stroll through the streets and appreciate the atmosphere of bygone days.\nWhile a history buff can easily spend a whole day here, casual travelers should plan to spend several hours at least, to enjoy the rural landscape and experience the 1,700 years of history and culture."}

Some are carefully cultivated, but many grow naturally on the fields and hillsides. Hikers from all over Japan and abroad come here to enjoy the ever-changing views.\nThis region's beauty is combined with a long and rich history. The area was an ancient center of politics, art, and culture, and it was here that Buddhism first took root in Japan. The traditional sport of sumo has roots here in Katsuragi. The shrines and temples celebrate both the history and the floral beauty of the region.\n### Don't Miss\n- Experience sumo in an authentic ring\n- View the many varieties of flowering trees at Taimadera Temple\n- See the 1,000-year-old gingko tree in Katsuragi Hitokotonushi-jinja Shrine\n## How to Get There\nKatsuragi is located on the west side of Nara Prefecture. It is accessible from Kyoto via a limited express train which takes around 90 minutes. From Osaka it takes around one hour. From Tokyo the journey is around three hours.\nFrom Tokyo, take the JR Tokaido Shinkansen to Shin-Osaka Station. At Shin-Osaka Station, transfer to the Midosuji Subway Line to Tennoji Station. From Abenobashi (Tennoji) it is around 45 minutes to Taima-dera Station by Kintetsu Minami-Osaka Line.\nFrom Kyoto, take the Kintetsu Kyoto/Kashihara Line and transfer at Kashihara-jingu-mae Station. After this it will take 15 minutes to Taima-dera Station by Kintetsu Minami-Osaka Line.\n### View seasonal blossoms from a mountain summit\nThe most visible landmark in the area is Mt. Katsuragi, a 950-meter-tall mountain that straddles the border of Nara and Osaka prefectures. It is home to a wide variety of flowers that bloom throughout the year.\nThe most popular of these is the rhododendron. There are thought to be more than one million of them in bloom every May, and this season is filled with hikers coming to enjoy the sea of red blossoms.\nFall is another popular time for hiking, with Japanese silver grass, regionally known as susuki, covering the hills. If hiking up a mountain is more than you are ready to take on, there is a ropeway that offers aerial views.\n### Significant in mythical and real history\nLike neighboring Nara and Asuka, Katsuragi is connected to some of the most ancient historical sites in Japan. It is named for the Katsuragi clan, an important family who lived in this area during the Kofun period, from the 3rd to the 5th century.\nKatsuragi is thought by some to be the real-life location of a mythical place, Takaamahara. According to Kojiki, the earliest historical record in Japan dating back to 711-712, Takaamahara was home to the gods.\n### Flower temples with historical roots\nThe temples in Katsuragi have a very long history, dating back almost to the arrival of Buddhism in Japan. Taimadera Temple was founded in 612. Its temple bell and stone lanterns are the oldest in Japan.\nThe grounds of Taimadera are covered with plum and cherry trees. This means that spring blossom season here can last months instead of weeks. But really, the gardens of this temple are beautiful at any season.\nAnother ancient temple nearby is Sekkoji Temple. It is located at the base of Mt. Nijo. It was built in the early 7th century and is home to the oldest stone Buddhas in Japan.\nLike Taimadera Temple, Sekkoji is known for its flowers, but especially for peony trees, of which it boasts more than 4,000. They typically bloom from late April to early May.\n### One word, one wish\nA Shinto shrine, Katsuragi Hitokotonushi-jinja Shrine, is dedicated to the god of that name, who is said to grant any wish, as long as it is only one word long. When you visit, be sure to think carefully and prepare your wish beforehand.\nA gingko tree in the shrine is believed to be over 1,200 years old. This tree has an unusual name, the breast tree, because of its unique shape. It is revered by women hoping to give birth and raise healthy children.\n### Experience Sumo in a realistic ring\nOn a different historical note, Katsuragi is considered to be the birthplace of sumo wrestling. A small museum, the Sumo-kan \"Kehaya-za,\" was opened in 1990 to arouse interest and help people understand this traditional sport. Some exhibits are interactive, and demonstrations are occasionally available.\nYou should plan to spend around three hours to see all of the main sites of the Katsuragi area, including the walks between locations. During spring, hiking may require additional time due to the crowds of flower-gazers."}

Ikoma and Mt. Shigi\n## How to Get There\nNara City is located east of Osaka City and south of Kyoto City and easily accessed by train from both. The city is served by two main stations – JR Nara Station and Kintetsu Nara Station – offering convenient connections depending on your route.\nFrom Osaka, the JR Yamatoji Rapid Service goes directly to JR Nara Station.\nFrom Kyoto, the JR Miyakoji Rapid Service goes directly to JR Nara Station.\nFrom other locations in Kyoto or Osaka, the Kintetsu private railway may be the most convenient alternative.\n## Nara Highlights\n### Visit the world's oldest wooden structures\nThe Ikaruga area near Nara City is home to Horyuji Temple, the world's oldest wooden building. Also worth a visit is the nearby Hokiji Temple, with its magnificent three-story pagoda. Both are UNESCO World Heritage Sites, packed with historical intrigue.\nAccess: Take the JR Yamatoji Line from JR Nara Station to Horyuji Station (10 minutes), then walk or take a bus from the station.\n### Explore Nara's Ancient Buddhist Heritage\nClose to central Nara is the site of what was once the most important building in Japan, Heijo Palace. Although little remains of the original structures, the buildings at the Heijo Palace site have been recreated using authentic period-appropriate materials.\nAccess: Take the Kintetsu-Nara Line from Kintetsu Nara Station to Yamato-Saidaiji Station, then walk for 20 minutes.\nThe only surviving part of the original palace is found at the nearby 8th century Toshodaiji . The simple, ancient buildings are architectural gems. Fans of historical architecture should also visit Yakushiji, which has an ancient pagoda dating back to A.D. 730.\n### Find Tranquility in Nara's Quiet Corner of Temple Heritage\nNear to this is the Saidaiji area. The two largest temples in this area are Akishino Temple, known for its peaceful moss garden, and Saidaiji, one of the Nanto Shichi Daiji, literally \"the seven great temples of the southern capital” (a.k.a. Nara).\nAccess: Take the Kintetsu Nara Line bus from Yamato-Saidaiji Station to Akishinodera Temple bus stop (5 minutes).\n## Is it worth travelling beyond central Nara?\nVisitors who are willing to travel a little further outside of the city will enjoy the Yamatokoriyama area. This area is only a short distance from sights such as Yakushiji and can be combined with them in a day trip.\nThe area is known for the spectacular Koriyama Castle. This castle is famous for its peaceful garden and its stone wall, which features stones from a variety of sources.\nThe defensive structure serves as a powerful reminder of Japan's military past. Yamatokoriyama is the center of the Japanese goldfish industry, and there is even a Goldfish Museum.\nAccess: Take the Kintetsu Kashihara Line from Kintetsu Nara Station to Kintetsu-Koriyama Station, or the JR Yamatoji Line from JR Nara Station to JR Koriyama Station (10 minutes).\n## Where Can You Hike Through History Near Nara?\nPeople looking to experience the more natural side of Nara should head to Kuragari-toge which combines a satisfying hike with deep history. This can be combined with a cultural experience at the nearby Hozanji Temple.\nAccess: Take the Kintetsu Nara Line from Kintetsu Nara Station to Minami-Ikoma Station (20 minutes).\nFurther afield is the Mt. Shigi area. The area's cultural attractions include Chogosonshiji Temple with its tiger-inspired architecture, and Kongosenji, famous for its hydrangeas.\nAccess: Take the JR Yamatoji Line from JR Nara Station to Oji Station (15 minutes), then transfer to a Nara Kotsu bus bound for Mt. Shigi (20 minutes).\nWhether you want to take your time with each location or see as much as possible in a day, Nara City is a great base for your adventures."}

Wakakusa full of very playful and friendly deer. The natural setting includes temples set in unspoiled woods and a lake full of turtles and carp. The temples and shrines of Nara are much older than the oft-rebuilt buildings in Kyoto, and much more unique.\n### Don't Miss\n- Interacting with the tame deer\n- The Great Buddha\n- Exploring Japan's Buddhist history through art and monuments\n## How to Get There\nAccess to central Nara is easiest from Osaka. Nara Station on JR lines is further away from the city center than Kintetsu Station.\nThe fastest way to get to Nara is the 35-minute limited rapid express from Osaka-Namba to Kintetsu Nara Station. This will cost 520 yen more than the regular express trains that take 5 minutes longer.\nKintetsu Nara can also be reached from Kyoto Station in just over 30 minutes.\nFrom Kintetsu Nara, the park is a 5-minute walk. The park can also be accessed from JR Nara Station with a 20-minute walk.\n### Great size and scale\nThe area around Nara Park is known for its incredible cultural heritage. The most famous and the first place most visitors go is the Great Buddha Hall at Todaiji.\nThis is the largest bronze statue of Buddha in the world, and weighs an estimated 300 tons. Inside what was once the largest wooden building in the world, the scale of this statue is awe-inspiring. Do not miss the less-visited temple buildings up the hill to the left of the Great Buddha.\nSimilarly impressive is the 50-meter tall pagoda at the neighboring Kofukuji. This magnificent construction makes it the second tallest five-story pagoda in Japan. The museum here is a must for lovers of Buddha statues.\nA quick walk away from the Great Buddha is Shinyakushiji, which is known for its statue of the Medicine Buddha. While a lot smaller in size than the Great Buddha, this Buddha is still very impressive, as it was laboriously carved from a single piece of wood, and the many statues that surround it are a very impressive and original sight.\n### A perfect balance\nNearby Kasuga Taisha balances perfectly the natural and cultural elements of the area. Walk to the shrine along a path through the woods, illuminated with innumerable stone lanterns during Setsubun Mantoro. At the shrine itself, the deep vermillion colored paint of the buildings perfectly complements the surrounding trees.\nDo not miss the Nara National Museum, with its unrivaled collection of Nara Period art.\nNara Park is known for its tame deer. While some caution is advised, it is possible to walk up to the deer and take a photograph with them or feed them with deer crackers on sale along the side of the road.\nFans of animals will also love Sarusawa pond. This is a great place to relax on the benches and watch turtles and carp swimming around.\nMany people take a classic photograph of Nara here, using the pond as a mirror to reflect the pagoda of Kofukuji and the beautiful trees.\n### A playground for avid photographers\nThe great park and the photogenic structures make central Nara a popular location for photographers.\nAnother popular photograph is a shot of the park from the Wakakusa mountain itself. The climb up the mountain offers a unique view of some of Nara's most famous sights. In the evening, in addition to being full of deer and birds, the mountain offers visitors a magnificent panoramic perspective of the Nara area.\nSet aside a few hours to view the park, feed the deer, and observe its cultural highlights at leisure."}

The mountain religion known as Shugendo started and flourished here, with Mt. Omine as a major center of ascetic practices. Tenkawa Daibenzaiten Shrine is another focus of worship, honoring the goddess of water in a village dominated by its small river.\nThe Tenkawa area is prime trekking territory as well. Relax in a healing hot spring in a secluded mountain setting after a long hike, and stay the night at one of the many inns in the area.\n### Don't Miss\n- The annual Noh performance at Tenkawa Daibenzaiten Shrine\n- Exploring the area around Mt. Omine\n- Sliding into the rumbling waters of Dorogawa Onsen\n## How to Get There\nYou can get to Tenkawa by car or bus from Nara Station.\nTenkawa is about a one-hour bus ride into Yoshinoyama in the center of Nara, at the foot of Mt. Omine.\nMt. Omine\n### The river of heaven, and a sacred power spot\nThe name of both the village and the river, Tenkawa, literally translates as \"river of heaven.\" The river runs right through the village, and there is a shrine here to Benzaiten, the goddess of water. Tenkawa Daibenzaiten Shrine, built in the 7th century is one of Japan's three largest shrines to the goddess and considered a major power spot by New Age enthusiasts.\nDespite its secluded location, the shrine regularly draws the rich and famous, which creates a buzz all its own. Since Benzaiten is also often worshipped as a goddess of the performing arts, the shrine holds a lavish annual Noh festival.\n### Mountains and spirits\nA center of the ancient Japanese mountain religion known as Shugendo, Tenkawa has long been home to ascetic religious practices. If you want to challenge yourself physically and spiritually, you can follow in the steps of the ascetics and climb Mt. Omine starting from Ryusen-ji Temple. One big caveat: this practice is strictly limited to men. Large stone markers warn that women are traditionally not allowed on the mountain.\nFortunately, nearby Dorogawa Onsen is a perfect alternative to engaging in an exhausting climb. Translating to \"rumbling water,\" these waters are a great way to relax your sore muscles after a long day of exploring the area.\n### Start trekking in Tenkawa\nTenkawa is a good jump off point for hiking, and ancient pilgrimage routes fan out from the settlement.

Yoshino, a UNESCO World Heritage site whose extraordinary beauty is worthy of the many poems written about it throughout the centuries.\n### Don't Miss\n- See the extraordinary display of about 30,000 cherry trees burst into color from late March through April\n- Walk in the footsteps of ancient mountain ascetics\n- Luxuriate in the area's mineral-rich hot springs\n## How to Get There\nAlthough it is in Nara Prefecture, access to the Yoshino area is easiest from Kyoto Station. Alternatively, you can get to the Yoshino area from Osaka.\nFrom Kyoto: At Kyoto Station, take the Kintetsu Line, which reaches Yoshino Station in about 1 hour 45 minutes.\nFrom Osaka: From Abenohashi Station in Osaka, it takes 1 hour 25 minutes on the Kintetsu Minami Osaka Line to Yoshino Station.\n## Why Visit Yoshino? A Sacred Mountain Steeped in History and Nature\nMuch of Yoshino in Nara Prefecture is a sprawling national park, encompassing the sacred Kii mountain range, now a UNESCO World Heritage site. Its heart is Mt. Yoshino, which has long been a symbol of spring in Japan. The mountain is featured heavily in classical literature, poetry and song.\n### Spring in Yoshino: Explore One of Japan's Most Famous Cherry Blossom Mountains\nYoshino's 30,000 cherry blossoms are a true sight to behold\nIn spring, Yoshino's ancient shrines and temples – many over 1,000 years old – are framed by the breathtaking bloom of about 30,000 iconic cherry trees. Notably, Yoshimizu-jinja Shrine offers prime views and is famed as the site where 16th-century warlord Toyotomi Hideyoshi once held a hanami (flower viewing) party perfectly timed to admire the blossoms.\n### Summer in Yoshino: Beat the Heat with Shady Mountain Paths and Historic Shrines\nThe summer greenery in Yoshino is fresh and vibrant, making it perfect for forest bathing and relaxing amidst nature\nIn summer, Yoshino's lush greenery surrounds historic sites like Nyoirinji Temple, which holds the mausoleum of Emperor Godaigo (1288-1339) – a pivotal figure in Japan's samurai era. Said to be the last emperor to wield real political power before the Meiji Restoration, Godaigo's dramatic story adds depth to your visit. The area also offers numerous hiking trails that weave through verdant forests and past ancient temples, making summer the perfect season to combine history with outdoor adventure.\n### Fall in Yoshino: Capture the Best Autumn Views\nFall in Yoshino offers yet more amazing photo opportunities\nAs autumn paints Yoshino in vibrant reds and golds, the legacy of Emperor Godaigo comes alive. Fleeing conflict, he established the Southern Court here to rival the Kyoto court under the shogun's rule. Nearby, Yoshino Jingu Shrine – dedicated to Godaigo – offers an impressive backdrop of fall foliage, making it a perfect spot to reflect on history amid nature's seasonal beauty.\nIn winter snowfall blankets the mountains behind Nyoirin-ji Temple\n### Winter in Yoshino: Embrace the Quiet Season and Festive Setsubun\nThe quietest out of all the seasons, winter provides a welcome reprise from the crowds, and a rare chance to see the famous hilly landscapes carpeted in snow. In early February, the town comes alive with the local Oni Fest, a vibrant celebration of Setsubun, the traditional Japanese holiday that marks the start of spring. Costumed “oni” ogres parade through the streets, taiko drums echo through the night, and the dramatic Oni Odori dance unfolds inside Zao Do at Kinpusen-ji Temple. Traditional rituals like a fire ceremony and bean throwing add a spiritual touch to this vibrant seasonal event.\n## Spiritual Heritage and Scenic Trail Highlights in Yoshino\nKimpusen-ji Temple is a must-visit spiritual spot in the Yoshino area\nBeyond the changing seasons, Yoshino's spiritual roots run deep. At the foot of Mt. Yoshino, the magnificent Zao-do Hall of Kimpusen-ji Temple stands as a testament to 8th-century ascetic En-no-Gyoja, the founder of Shugendo Japan's second-largest traditional wooden structure, the first being the Great Buddha Hall in Nara.\nKeep an eye out for Shugendo monks in their eye-catching robes\nShugendo practitioners undertake rigorous ascetic rituals, including fasting and purification under icy waterfalls – a tradition still visible today as pilgrims in distinctive robes blow their conch shells while trekking the sacred trails. Exploring these paths offers a unique glimpse into Japan's ancient mountain worship and spiritual heritage, complementing the natural beauty of Yoshino throughout the year.\n## When Is the Best Time to Visit Yoshino for Hiking and Hot Springs?\nYoshino makes a great day trip from other cities in the Kansai area, but you may wish to stay overnight to make the most of the hot springs here. With dozens of trails, the Yoshino area is a haven for a combination of hiking and onsen soaks. The best way to beat the crowds in the cherry blossom season is to stay overnight and then see the blossoms in the early morning before the trains arrive."}

In Shinsaibashi, and among the bright lights of the Dotonbori district, you'll find some of the best shopping and eating in Osaka. Come and experience the liveliest and most colorful area of Osaka.\n### Don't Miss\n- Dotonbori's lively night atmosphere\n- Shinsaibashi-suji Shopping Street, eight blocks of retail heaven\n- People watching in Amerikamura, where the cool kids hang out\n## How to Get There\nShinsaibashi and Dotonbori are easily accessible via train from all points in Osaka.\nFrom Osaka/Umeda Station, take the Midosuji Line to Shinsaibashi Station. Look for the exit to the Shinsaibashi-suji Shopping Street shopping arcade. If you walk the length of the arcade you will emerge at Ebisubashi bridge in Dotonbori. Alternatively, to reach Dotonbori directly continue on the Midosuji Line train to Namba Station.\n### 400 years of entertainment and counting\nShopkeepers and merchants have been plying their trade around Shinsaibashi since the 1600s when an enterprising merchant (named Shinsai) built a bridge connecting the up-and-coming Shinmachi quarter to the theater district of Dotonbori.\nWhile the traditional kabuki theaters and entertainment halls of Dotonbori are almost impossible to find anymore, there's no lack of drama and entertainment to be had in the lively streets where Osaka still comes to play. Packed with shops, bars and restaurants this is where you'll find the city at its most frenetic.\n### Shop, eat, drink, repeat\nAlmost a mile long, Shinsaibashi arcade stretches from Shinsaibaishi station to Dotonbori and is one of the busiest and oldest shopping streets in Japan. There are shops to suit every budget and tastes from high fashion to traditional crafts. Add on a limitless selection of cafes and restaurants, and you'll be lucky to emerge before nightfall.\n### At the center of it all: the Dotonbori Bridge\nThe Dotonbori district sits beside a 400-year-old canal. The bridge over the canal is a popular place to take your photo (look out for the Glico Man; the enormous runner towers over Ebisubashi Bridge and is a famous Osaka landmark).\nThe bright lights and bars of Dotonbori draw huge nighttime crowds. Exuberant neon signs plus an assortment of giant mechanical sea creatures and clowns looking down on the action add to the fun.\n### Kuidaore (eat until you drop): dining Osaka-style\nIt won't take long to work up an appetite with the multitude of eating and drinking options in your path. The alleys and streets surrounding Dotonbori are packed with izakaya, restaurants and bars. The crab restaurants here are famous. Or try Osaka-style sushi. Many of the larger establishments have English menus.\nAlong the riverside promenade you'll find stalls serving takoyaki, steaming bowls of ramen, okonomiyaki joints and an abundance of drinking spots. Pause for a drink while you watch the world passing by and enjoy the lights reflected in the water. If you feel overwhelmed by crowds, turn off the main drag into the quieter lantern-filled Hozenji Yokocho for a choice of traditional restaurants.\n### Amerikamura: street fashion and youth culture\nWest of Shinsaibashi, Amerikamura is named for its origins as a place to buy US goods after World War II and new and retro Americana abounds. This is where Osaka teens strut their stuff in a diverting fashion parade of Japanese street style.\nStop in Triangle Park (a tiny concrete seating place) to check out the latest trends before browsing the vintage clothing and record stores. There are plenty of quirky cafes to hang out in and if you stay till late, clubs and live music venues.\nMany stores don't open until after 11 a.m., so arrive later in the day when Amerikamura's habitues are awake. The place fills up at weekends when there are flea markets and buskers in the mix.\n### Orange Street\nOsaka's furniture-making district, Orange Street t and the surrounding Horie neighborhood has reinvented itself as a hub for designer clothing and trendy cafes. While it remains home to a few old-school furniture makers, the narrow streets are now lined with an eclectic mix of stylish boutiques, hip lifestyle stores and coffee shops."}

A uniquely Japanese spectacle, the Revue (think Broadway glamor and classic drama combined) and its performers have a large and loyal following.\nThe cast members, who undergo rigorous training beginning in childhood, are renowned nationally for their dedication to the troupe and performing arts, and for their legions of enamored fans. Watching the interactions between fans and players is almost as entertaining as the Revue.\nYou can book tickets for performances through Takarazuka's English website, which also describes the current production and lists the performance dates and times.\n### An array of easy hiking trails nearby\nTakarazuka is a good base from which to explore the surrounding foothills and rivers following a handful of easy hiking trails.\nPhoto of Takarazuka\n### Planning your time in the area\nIt takes less than an hour to escape the city for the peace and tranquility of the countryside.

Ascend to the top of castle keep tower to look over the expansive castle grounds and neighboring skyscrapers. Or bring a bento box and enjoy a picnic surrounded by groves of cherry and apricot trees which are amazing in bloom in the spring.\n### Don't Miss\n- Cherry blossom party time in the castle park\n- The many exhibits at the Museum of History\n## How to Get There\nFrom Osaka/Umeda Station, take the JR Osaka Loop Line to Morinomiya Station. You will arrive directly adjacent to Osaka Castle Park.\n### A bloody past concluding in a long period of peace\nThe original castle was built between 1583 to 1598 by Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who re-unified Japan in 1590 after a century of civil war. His regime was replaced in 1603 by the Tokugawa Shogunate, located in Edo (Tokyo). The last of the Toyotomi line committed suicide here at the castle when it was burnt to the ground in 1615.\nThe current castle is a reconstruction of the castle the Tokugawa built to replace Hideyoshi's castle. The castle was under the direct control of the Shogun, and the massive double moats and stone walls were a daunting obstacle for any would-be invaders. This history is still celebrated and remembered, as the fall of the castle corresponds closely with the start of the Edo Period — an altogether peaceful and prosperous time for Japan.\n### Springtime nostalgia\nThe early April cherry blossom season sees hordes of high-spirited locals spending the afternoon and evening hours drinking and partying under the pink canopy of the blossoms, with the illuminated castle adding historical depth to the scenery. Such parties are a significant part of Japanese culture, with the season and affiliated memories referenced throughout literature and film.\n### See the history firsthand at the adjacent museum\nLearn more about the castle's history and Japan's Edo period at the adjacent Museum of History. The multiple floors and abundance of exhibits provide a stimulating look into how Japan flourished during the 260-year period of peace and suddenly rocketed onto the global stage, spurred by massive development starting in the late 19th century.\n### Explore the surrounding city\nThe swath of skyscrapers visible to the north of Osaka Castle is part of a business district called Kyobashi. Take an evening journey through the streets to find a slightly seedier, grittier version of Umeda's business district. There are a number of bars and restaurants to enjoy a meal in the company of white collar employees who have loosened their ties and rolled up their sleeves after a long day of work.\n### Planning a trip\nPart of what makes Osaka so appealing is that the city is packed into a relatively small area within the JR Osaka Loop Line. Osaka Castle is easily accessible from both the north and south side of the city, meaning you can visit it for anywhere from an hour to a full day without needing to adjust your accommodations or concern yourself with the train schedules."}

Due to their proximity to Kansai International Airport, they are ideal stopping-off points before a flight or during a long layover.\n### Don't Miss\n- Daisenryo Kofun—one of the world's largest ancient mausoleums at Sakai\n- Sakai's world-renowned crafts\n- The high-octane Kishiwada Danjiri Matsuri festival\n## How to Get There\nSakai and Kishiwada lie southeast of Osaka en route to Kansai International Airport.\nBoth cities are within an hour of Osaka and easy to reach by train using the Nankai or JR Hanwa Line via Tennoji Station, or directly from the Airport.\nFor Daisenryo Kofun, take the JR Hanwa Line to Mozu Station from where the mausoleum is a five-minute walk.\n### Sakai ancient and modern\nThe city of Sakai has a rich and colorful history. A prosperous merchant town and trading port in the 16th century, it is also the birthplace of revered tea master Sen no Rikyu. Today Sakai is renowned for its craft cutlery industry (Sakai knives are much sought after by chefs) and precision bicycle manufacture, and has museums devoted to both. Its most remarkable claim to fame, however, is the site of one of the largest mausoleums on the planet.\n### Tombs to rival the pyramids\nSakai's ancient burial mounds with their distinctive keyhole design were built on a scale that rivals the pyramids. The central mound, known in Japanese as Daisen Kofun, is believed to contain the remains of the legendary fourth century Emperor Nintoku. Dating from the fifth century, the tomb covers 1.3 million square feet (room for 12 baseball fields) and is reckoned to have taken at least 15 years and 2,000 laborers to construct.\nThe mausoleum, set amidst the urban sprawl of 21st-century Sakai, is enclosed by three moats and the burial mounds are now covered in lush vegetation. The site is considered sacred and visitors may venture no further than the outer moat. To make sense of the site, it is best viewed from the observation deck on the 21st floor of Sakai City Hall. Back on the ground, you can walk around the peaceful outer moat (2.5 miles).\nTo learn more about the history and archaeology of Daisenryo Kofun, watch a short film in English provided by the Sakai City Museum in the park across the street.\n### Pedal power\nSakai is a pleasant city to tour by bike. You can rent cycles from the tourist office and routes are well signposted in English.\n### Kishiwada—serene castle and riotous festival\nIn addition to a delightful castle (less crowded than its more famous neighbor in Osaka), the annual Kishiwada Danjiri Festival is famous throughout Japan. A lively, noisy affair, it attracts 500,000 visitors during the third weekend of September.\n### Rocking and rolling\nThirty-five ornately crafted floats (danjiri) each weighing over four tons are hauled through the streets by hundreds of townspeople at breakneck speed. Hundreds more run alongside and behind while atop each float the Daiku-Gata, a wild and fearless master of ceremonies urges on his crew, performing feats of daring on the roof.\nLike the bull runners of Pamplona, rival teams race their floats with little regard for their own safety. Stand well back as the floats pass by. It takes skill and experience to navigate tight corners along the route and accidents and injuries are not unusual (no wonder the festivities begin with prayers for the safety of the runners).\nAs evening sets in, the festival continues (though at a more leisurely pace) as revelers enjoy beers and street food and the rivalries of the day are forgotten.\nFloats & Daiku-Gata on floats at the festival in Sakai-shi\n### Last minute shopping at Rinku Town\nFrom Sakai and Kishiwada, it's a short hop to Rinku Town (and one stop from the airport).

Shin-Osaka is the home of Osaka's bullet train, while Osaka Station and Umeda Station to the south are the hub for all local transportation.\n### Don't Miss\n- Getting lost in the never-ending maze of shopping centers and train stations in Umeda\n- A leisurely walk along the river in Nakanoshima\n- Eating in Tenma, Osaka's favorite place to dine\n## How to Get There\nAs the main transportation hub into Osaka, this area is easily accessible by train.\nIt's confusing for locals and tourists alike to distinguish Shin-Osaka, Osaka Station and Umeda Station. There are a handful of major stations in the north of Osaka with similar names or similar locations.\nShin-Osaka is the station where the shinkansen stops. Osaka Station is the main hub for all local commuter trains and subways. These two stations are four kilometers apart. Adding to the confusion, Umeda Station is right next door to Osaka Station and is where all the other train companies' trains stop.\nIf arriving via shinkansen, exit the shinkansen turnstile and head for the JR train bound for Osaka Station (on the Tokaido Line). Exit Osaka Station to find yourself in the city's central transportation and business hub. Every other destination and attraction in Osaka can be easily accessed via an Osaka/Umeda Station train line.\n### Osaka is the kitchen of Japan, and Tenma is the kitchen of Osaka\nEveryone loves a good meal, but Osakans take dining to a whole other level. The sheer concentration of restaurants and izakayas, which at times seem to outnumber housing and offices should be a testament to this. Tenma is the pinnacle of this obsessive dining culture.\n### Nakanoshima—the municipal center of the city\nThe center of government in Osaka, Nakanoshima is a well-designed and beautifully manicured slice of the city. This thin strip of land stretches four plus kilometers east to west. Nakanoshima is home to the city hall, a handful of museums and historically preserved buildings, and a beautiful promenade and park for walking. Come in temperate weather to enjoy a leisurely stroll stopping at the museums and various points of interest along the way.\n### Planning a trip\nWith the crowds of people flowing from one path to the next, Umeda and the surrounding northern area of the city can seem a little overwhelming but is certainly worth experiencing, particularly if you are a fan of urban spaces and efficient development.\n### The essence of urban Japan\nGiven the number of people who come through the station everyday, it's incredible that the trains manage to stay on time, the streets manage to preserve their clean appearance and pedestrians maintain a generally calm composure despite the chaos seeming to erupt from all directions."}

From Kansai International Airport, take the express train on the JR Line to Tennoji Station.\nFrom Osaka/Umeda Station, ride the Midosuji Subway line or JR Osaka Loop Line\n### Deep for a reason\nOsakans use the English-derived word \"deep\" to describe the area's ambience, referring to the less refined, grittier nature of the streets and establishments.\nThough the streets directly around Tennoji Station have recently been redeveloped around the Abeno Harukas, duck into the untouched alleyways to experience how the Japanese get \"deep.\"\n### Soar above the clouds at the top of Japan's tallest skyscraper\nAt 300 meters, Abeno Harukas offers a comprehensive view of the entire metropolitan area. Buy a ticket and ride all the way to the top to get a look at the vast city below. The building also caters to shoppers, with high-end consumer goods occupying the first 12 floors. There are restaurants, cafes, an art museum and a hotel located on the premises.\n### See what Osaka looked like 100 years ago in Shinsekai\nDeveloped in the early 1900s, Shinsekai offers a glimpse into a Japan from generations past. The country began modernizing in the 1860s, introducing western-style design and popular culture into everyday society. Melding with Japan's own sensibilities, what resulted is flashy and bold. Get a first-hand look into this cross-cultural hybridization in Shinsekai, all while drinking cold beer and eating a hefty portion of fried food.\n### Relax around Tennoji Park\nTake a break in the recently redeveloped Tennoji Park. On weekends, the lawns fill with happy young families picnicking and playing in the park, which is overshadowed by the massive Harukas Tower next door. This is the perfect place to get a sense of the surrounding geography before you depart for your next adventure.\n### Visit Shitenno-ji Temple and discover the origins of Buddhism in Japan\nAside from being the oldest official temple in Japan, Shitennoji Temple boasts a five-storyed pagoda, unique architecture, and many seasonal festivities. The temple is not just a tourist destination, but is popular with the locals, who congregate here especially during the Autumn obon holidays.\nThey also partake in the Doya Doya festival, when young men—half naked—are drenched in ice cold water. The temple's massive grounds offer refuge from the dense surrounding city.\n### Delight in Osaka's classic food and drink culture\nNotice the slender standing-only bars filled with middle-aged and elderly Japanese? These are called tachinomi (standing bars), and are a particularly common feature of the Tennoji and Shinsekai area. Drink alongside a combination of blue and white collar clientele, who gather at tachinomi for the unpretentious atmosphere and lively conversation.\nIn addition to tachinomi, head to Shinsekai to try Osaka's famous kushikatsu (deep fried skewers). Get your fill of the assorted thin cuts of meat, fish and vegetables, which are fried to a delectable crisp."}

Pei-designed gem of an art museum\n- A village dedicated to pottery and ceramics\n## How to Get There\nIf you're coming from Kyoto, take the JR Tokaido line to Kusatsu, and then the Kusatsu Line to Koka. From Tokyo, take the shinkansen heading for Shin-Osaka and transfer at Maibara and then again at Kusatsu.\nNote that there is also a Kusatsu in Gunma Prefecture, so make sure not to mix them up. Head towards the Kusatsu in Shiga Prefecture and take the 36 minute trip on the Kusatsu Line to Koka.\n### So you want to be a ninja?\nThe Koka region became famous in the 15th century for its clans of shinobi (\"sneaky\") fighters. Training in the rugged hills, they lived outside the samurai code of honor. These spies and mercenaries became more commonly known as ninja and acquired a mythical place in popular culture.\nToday, Koka retains an original ninja house where a family of ninja lived and is also home to another ninja attractionーthe Koka Ninja Village. Both spots offer a chance to learn how the ninja trained. You can even try your hand at some of the tricks of the trade.\nKoka Ninja House (left) and Koka Ninja Village (right)\n### A Shangri-La of art hidden in the hills\nThe Miho Museum was designed by Chinese-American architect I.M. Pei and bears many of his signature design elements. The museum, which is literally cut out of a mountainside, houses the private art collection of one of Japan's wealthiest women and the founder of a religious organization that emphasizes the appreciation of beauty. Pei himself called it Shangri-La, a heaven on earth among nature. Fans of Western classical art or treasures from the Middle East and the Silk Road will find the museum of particular interest.\nA view from inside the Miho Museum\n### Centuries of clay\nAny visitor to Japan will notice the extreme variety and quality of Japanese pottery and ceramics. The Shigaraki area has been recognized for centuries as one of Japan's six great pottery regions, and The Shigaraki Ceramic Cultural Park is its modern epicenter.\nPottery buffs will love its exhibits, hands-on experiences, and annual pottery sales. Those less aesthetically inclined can pick up a famous tanuki statue for good luck. The statue represents Japan's friendly raccoon dog who's always looking for someone to drink with and can often be found in the doorways of local drinking establishments.\nNobori-gama pottery kilns in Shigaraki"}

The impressive Hachiman-bori Canal provided transport, helping to make the city a powerhouse of trade. Later, Hachiman was added to the name of the town in honor of the Shinto god of war, who has a home in town at Himure Hachimangu Shrine.\n### A merchant city dripping with history\nThe wealth and generosity of the early Omi traders may be seen in the many temples and other public works housed in the town. Today, the Shin-Machi Dori area gives visitors a well-preserved taste of how the famous Omi merchants lived. The Omihachiman City Museum is a perfect example of a building from Omi's heyday, and houses exhibits on folk materials.\n### Zen temple nestled amoung mountains\nEigenji Temple is a Zen temple where water is deeply involved in the faith. The temple is located in Higashiomi City, in a mountainous region. It is a Japan Heritage Site for the water culture that developed in the area.

At the climax of the festival, all the sagicho are burned while locals dance around the fire.\n### Cruise through the history of Omihachiman\nBefore the invention of automobiles, the town's canal was a major source of transportation, making the area a bustling commercial hub. This main artery also divided the town until the mid-nineteenth century. On the north side lived samurai, and on the south, commoners. Wander along the canal and feel the influence this waterway has had on the area.\n### Explore a little deeper\nSitting right on the border of Lake Biwa, the largest lake in Japan, Omihachiman is a great place to set up base for a day or two.

The JR Limited Express Wide View Nanki trains from Nagoya will get you to Shingu in around three and half hours.\n### Hidden hall of the mountain gods\nOne of the three Kumano grand shrines, Kumano Hongu Taisha Shrine is the jewel of the Hongu area and houses the shrine's gods. Emerging from the forest paths to see the sweeping wooden roofs set amongst ancient cedar and cypress is very memorable.\nIts current location up in the mountains was a consequence of a devastating flood in 1889 that swept away many of the buildings in its original location of Oyunohara. Visit Oyunohara today and you will see a giant 33-meter-tall torii gate, the tallest in Japan.\n### Healing waters of history\nYunomine Onsen is a tiny mountain hamlet lined with rustic inns that have been pumping up mineral-rich hot water to soothe and heal the weary souls of travelers for centuries.\nThese springs are an integral part of the Kumano Kodo, as the gushing spring waters were used by pilgrims to purify their bodies before worshipping at the grand shrine. The most famous of the baths, Tsuboyu, is a designated World Heritage site that you can enjoy alone or in a small group for up to 30 minutes. The bath is richly storied and even featured in a kabuki play.\n### Dig your own onsen\nLocated along the same bus route as Yunomine and Kumano Hongu Taisha Shrine, Kawayu Onsen has been blessed with a rare gift: the river that separates the cluster of inns and steep mountain slopes forms its own long, winding hot spring as geothermal water bubbles up to the surface.\nIn the winter, the river transforms into one enormous bath where many people can crowd into the warm waters. From spring through fall, a little work with a shovel by the banks will reward you with your own private outdoor bath.\n### Following the sacred steps\nThe ancient pilgrimage route that snakes its way through the rugged terrain of the Kii mountain range is one of only two pilgrimage routes listed by UNESCO as World Heritage sites-the other being the Routes of Santiago de Compostela in Spain and France.\nFor centuries, the paths have been walked by the whole social spectrum of society: from royalty and samurai warriors to monks and lay people, each searching for spiritual enlightenment from the Kumano deities.\nThe full walk from the coast to Kumano Hongu Taisha Shrine is nearly 30 kilometers and involves an overnight stay in between, but if you're pressed for time, you can take a bus to Hosshinmon Oji and stroll the final 7-kilometer section in about two hours."}

Stroll through over 1,200 years of history in this vast, peaceful complex, with over 100 temples scattered throughout the grounds.\n### Don't Miss\n- Experience an extraordinary retreat in one of the 52 temples offering accommodation\n- Treat your body to some spiritually healthy Buddhist cuisine\n- Touring Okunoin Temple in the dark of night without the crowds\n## How to Get There\nEast of Osaka Prefecture in northern Wakayama, Koyasan is accessible by train and cable car or bus from Wakayama, Osaka, and Nara.\nTraditionally, Koyasan was the end of a long journey along the Kumano Kodo pilgrimage route, which you can still walk, and many do.\nFrom the Osaka area, you can also get there faster by train from Namba Station. Take the Nankai Koya line to Gokuraku-bashi Station (minimum 90 minutes) and a five-minute cable car up to Koyasan.\nBuses are also available for your trip around Koyasan.\n### Explore the center of Shingon Buddhism\nKongobuji Temple is the head temple of Shingon Buddhism in Japan. Take off your shoes and wander through the temple halls, adorned with graceful carved wooden cranes, elaborate flowers, and gilded sliding doors.\n### Monk-style bed and breakfast\nWhile options for temporary residence have never been greater for the modern traveler, one of the more interesting and tranquil choices is to spend a night at a temple. Temples offering lodgings are called shukubo.\nOver 50 temples in Koyasan offer the opportunity for weary travelers to recharge their spiritual batteries. It is recommended, though not mandatory, to take part in some of the monks' spiritual practices such as meditation and copying sutras.\n### Shojin ryori—high-class cuisine for body and soul\nUsing only vegetables and wild plants, shojin ryori skillfully adapts to the changing seasons to provide nourishing food for the body and soul. This vegetarian Buddhist cuisine focuses on delivering the true essence of each ingredient. Shukubo serve shojin ryori meals to overnight guests, but it is also possible to get Buddhist lunches at some of the eateries in the temple town.\n### Okunoin Temple—a journey that counts\nOne of the most important places in Koyasan is Okunoin Temple, the mausoleum of the monk Kukai, an influential and revered religious figure. In Buddhism, though, it's not the destination, but the journey that counts.\nThe cobbled pathway leading to Okunoin passes by over 200,000 mossy gravestones and memorials under a thick green canopy of ancient cedar trees. Famous historical figures, great samurai, and royalty rub shoulders with more prosaic modern heroes of business and industry.\n### Koyasan tours and experiences\nOne of the big draws of a visit to Koyasan is the range of experiences and activities on offer from meditation, sutra-copying and matcha tea experiences to private tours with a monk as your tour guide.\nIf you only have time for a single tour, reserve a spot on the Okunoin Night Tour, which departs every evening (except on the 20th of the month) from Ekoin Temple. An English-speaking monk will lead you through the cemetery by torchlight recounting anecdotes and letting you in on little-known secrets.\nApart from the other tour participants, you will have Okunoin entirely to yourself, without the daytime crowds. If lucky, you may be able to spot flying squirrels and fireflies."}

A powerful waterfall set in a primeval forest is the natural focus of this spiritual home for worshippers of the mountain gods.\n### Don't Miss\n- Thundering spirituality at the base of Japan's tallest vertical drop waterfall\n- Seeing the summer set ablaze at the Nachi Fire Festival\n- An untouched cobblestone staircase believed to be a pathway to the gods\n## How to Get There\nLocated south of Nara, in Wakayama Prefecture, the Nachisan area is accessible by public transportation.\nFrom Wakayama's Kii-Katsuura Station, take a 30-minute bus ride to Nachi-no-Taki-mae. For those traveling to the area from outside Wakayama Prefecture, the JR Kisei Honten Line will conveniently take you straight from Nagoya or Shin-Osaka down to Kii-Katsuura. The journey from Nagoya takes just under four hours and features commanding views of the Wakayama coastline along the way.\n### Quick Facts\nNachi Waterfall is the tallest waterfall in Japan, at 133 meters\nThe waterfall has been revered from ancient times by the Japanese as the home of a Shinto deity\n### Daimonzaka–the stairway to heaven\nLeading from the base of the valley up to the spiritual sanctities of Kumano Nachi Taisha Shrine, Seigantoji Temple and Nachi Waterfall, this cobbled, gently sloping staircase offers around 600 meters of the Kumano Kodo Pilgrimage Route.\nSheltered under a canopy of cedar, camphor, and bamboo, you can also climb the 267 steps in a Heian-period kimono for the full pilgrim experience.\n### Kumano Nachi Taisha Shrine—a sacred stop-off\nTucked away up on the mountainside, Kumano Nachi Taisha Shrine is one of the spiritual stops on the Kumano Kodo Pilgrimage Route and is one of the three sacred shrines dotted along the ancient trail. The goddess enshrined here is Musubinokami. As this can be translated as “tie a knot,” she is known as the deity of marriage.\n### Seigantoji Temple–a beautiful Buddhist structure\nRubbing shoulders with the Shinto Kumano Nachi Taisha Shrine is the Buddhist Seigantoji Temple. The two spiritual homes housing different faiths used to be joined as one until politics forced the two religions to split in the 19th century.\nTheology aside, the striking, sharp red edges of the temple's famous pagoda stand in the foreground of the roaring Nachi Waterfall. Seigantoji Temple is a magnificent sight that you should not miss.\n### Nachi Waterfall–an ancient water god\nIf you peer up at the top of the waterfall, you can make out zigzag paper hangings, tied to a rope strung a few meters above the cascade. These are known as shide and signify the dwelling of a god.\nJapan's earliest records indicate that the waterfall has been worshipped as the abode of a Shinto deity since ancient times, and this explains the reason for Nachi Taisha and Seigantoji being built here in later times. Standing in front of such natural power will leave a lasting impression.\n### Nachi Fire Festival—purification through a festival of fire\nEvery year, mid-July sees the area lit by flame as the Nachi-no-Ogi festival is held. Beginning at Kumano Nachi Taisha Shrine, torch-bearers clad in white swing giant flaming torches to purify the ancient path leading to the waterfall. The event climaxes with twelve portable shrines set alight to a backdrop of chanting, smoke, and flame."}

Alternatively, the Nakahechi-route leads from Tanabe deep into the mountains, destined for the third sacred shrine of Hongu Taisha.\n©Nanki Shirahama Tourism Association\n### Aquatic bliss\nSitting at the southernmost point of the peninsula, the warm current that flows into the waters of Kushimoto makes for bountiful fishing. Colonies of table coral play host to dazzling tropical fish, darting in and out of their jagged, colorful fronds. Scuba diving is popular here, along with glass-bottomed boat tours for sub-aqua viewing."}
