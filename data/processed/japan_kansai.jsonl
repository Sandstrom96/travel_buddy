Sample perfectly marbled Kobe beef and akashiyaki—the local take on takoyaki octopus balls.\n## How to Get There\nHyogo Prefecture’s two largest cities are Kobe and Himeji and are easily accessed by bullet train.\nTravel to and from Tokyo, Nagoya, Hiroshima and Fukuoka is an easy journey on the Tokaido-Sanyo Shinkansen to Shin-Kobe Station or Himeji Station. Hyogo is a short ride on commuter rail from Osaka and Kyoto. For access by air, Kobe is about an hour from Kansai International Airport, while Kobe Airport handles domestic flights. If you're traveling by car, the prefecture is well-linked by road.

In the months leading up to winter, hunters would bring home their tusked prizes and make a hot pot dish known as botan nabe that you can still enjoy in the region today.\n- Akashi Sea Bream\nThe sea bream flourishes in the waters off the coast of Akashi, and the ones caught here have an exceptional depth of flavor and a texture that is suited for both sashimi and grilling. Sea bream is a traditional dish at celebrations in Japan, so celebrate by trying it here.\n- Kobe Beef\nWithin Japan, \"Kobe beef\" refers to beef cattle from Tajima. It is characterized by its marbling, flavor and fat that has a melting point lower than human body temperature.\n- Kuromame\nTamba black beans, known as kuromame, are grown in the Kyoto area and used in several ways in local cuisine. That includes being mashed with sugar and used to make sweets, or roasted until crunchy and served as a snack alongside ice-cold beer.\n- Toyooka Willow Basketry\nWillow basketry in Toyooka has stood the test of time—it's been around for more than 1,000 years. Originally used for household baskets and bento boxes back in the 9th century, today these time-honored weaving techniques are used to make stylish overnight bags and handbags.\n- Banshu Miki Forged Blades\nCenturies ago, tragedy turned into opportunity—rebuilding the razed Miki Castle transformed this region into a bladesmithing center. Custom-crafted saws, knives, chisels and other tools hand-forged in Miki are used and treasured by carpenters and others across Japan.\n- Izushi Ware\nIzushi yaki porcelain dates back to the 18th century discovery of kaolin-rich clay in Izushi.

Early forms were stylized with natural ash glazes, while slip glazes were introduced later.\n## Seasonal Highlights\n- Spring\nDuring cherry blossom season, the prefecture turns pink and the area surrounding Himeji Castle is particularly breathtaking. Enjoy the Kobe Festival and witness the yearly mountain burnoff in the Tonomine Highlands.\n- Summer\nThe hotter months are a time for outdoor adventures and festivals. Head to the cooler climes of some of Hyogo’s mountains, or down to the beaches of Suma, Ieshima or Awaji Island for fun and fireworks.\n- Autumn\nAutumn in Hyogo means spectacular events such as the Nada Fighting Festival, Kobe Jazz Street and the Tamba Momiji Meguri (Maple Leaf Tour), as well as cool temperatures for the Kobe Marathon.\n- Winter\nThe cold winter months are perfect for a ski trip and onsen getaway, and the Kinosaki area is perfect for both."}

Throughout its history, Awaji Island has acted as a vital connection between Honshu and Shikoku. There is much history to be found here, including the world's longest suspension bridge and several wonderful beaches.\n### Quick Facts\n- Sumoto City is located at the center of Awaji Island\n- At almost four kilometers in length, the Akashi Kaikyo Bridge is the world's longest suspension bridge and connects Awaji with Kobe\n- Goshikigahama's name refers to the colorful shimmering pebbles lining the beach\n## How to Get There\nConnecting the city of Kobe and the city of Naruto by bridge, Awaji Island is best accessed by car. You can also reach the island via bus or ferry.\nBuses run between Kobe City, Kobe Airport and Sumoto City on the island of Awaji. There are no trains on the island, and aside from bus services, there is limited public transport on the island. It is possible to take the ferry connecting Akashi Port to Iwaya Port on the north of the island. To the south, the island is connected by suspension bridge to Naruto, Shikoku.\n### Sumoto City\nSumoto City is located in the center of Awaji Island. The city is home to a number of historic sites that pre-date modern Japanese history.\nSumoto Castle on Mt. Mikumayama is said to have been built in 1526 by the Ataka clan, who led the Awaji Suigun Navy. The castle changed owners several times before it was abandoned, but the ruins of the castle and its reconstructed castle tower remain on the mountain today.\n### The world's longest suspension bridge\nAt almost four kilometers in length, the Akashi Kaikyo Bridge is the world's longest suspension bridge. The bridge connects Kobe City to Awaji Island and continues to Shikoku as part of the Kobe-Awaji Naruto Expressway. The bridge has 1084 lights that are used for illuminations during times of national celebration or during certain holidays and other events, creating a spectacular light show.\n### A beach of colored pebbles\nGoshikihama is on the western coast of Awaji Island and offers fantastic views towards the blue waters of the Seto Inland Sea. The name Goshiki refers to the five colors of the beach's pebbles, which shine like gems at sunset. The western orientation of the Beach offers fantastic views of the sunset. Numerous other popular beaches are located along the coasts of Awaji Island.\n### The Naruto whirlpools\nOne of the island's most famous attractions is the Naruto Whirlpools, which form in the strait between Awaji Island and Shikoku. The pools form as the tides force water in and out of the strait and are observable from Onaruto Bridge, which crosses the strait. For a more up-close look, you can book a cruise from the port in Minami-Awaji.\n### Ando's architecture\nTwo buildings designed by the iconic Japanese architect Tadao Ando can be found on Awaji Island—the Water Temple and Awaji Yumebutai. The Water Temple is a temple belonging to the Omuro School of Shingon Buddhism. Awaji Yumebutai is a group of facilities, including an international conference center, famous for the 100 terraced flowerbeds arranged on the grounds."}

But that's not all the city offers, and there's plenty to enjoy within the city and the surrounding areas.\n### Don't Miss\n- Himeji Castle: Over 400 years old, this is one of Japan's most iconic castles\n- Engyoji Temple: Located on Mt. Shosha, this temple is a popular feature in period films about Japan\n## How to Get There\nHimeji is on the Tokaido-Sanyo Shinkansen Line and is well connected to Tokyo. The JR Rail Pass covers this trip.\nThe bullet train from Tokyo Station to Himeji Station takes around three hours. Highway buses connect the city to Tokyo and several companies offer overnight bus services.\n### Himeji Castle\nHimeji Castle is both a Japanese National Treasure and a World Heritage site. Its status as one of Japan's 12 original castles and the fact it has survived four centuries without significant damage from war, earthquake or fire makes this castle a must-see. It is the finest surviving example of Japanese castle architecture, comprised of 83 buildings. The castle is called the Heron Castle because of its distinctive white plasterwork.\nOver 1,000 cherry trees can be found in the castle's grounds. Viewing those located in the castle's outer areas is free of charge, but if you'd like to see the blossoms in the inner castle you must pay the castle admission fee of around 1,000 yen. While the castle is arguably at its best during sakura season, it is also at its most crowded.\n### Kokoen Gardens\nKokoen is a large Japanese garden located next to Himeji Castle. It consists of nine separate, walled gardens designed in various styles of the Edo period. The gardens were opened in 1992 to commemorate the centenary of Himeji City and are built on the former site of the residence of Himeji Castle's lord.\n### Fashionable festivals\nFrom June 22 to June 24 each year, the area around Osakabe-jinja Shrine in the center of Himeji is transformed. Thousands of people arrive for the annual Himeji Yukata Festival, a celebration of the colorful “Yukata”, a traditional summer garment.\nThe Nada Kenka Matsuri is held every October at Matsubara Hachiman-jinja Shrine in Himeji. The festival is referred to as a fighting festival as participants slam portable shrines known as mikoshi into one another in a display of dominance.\n### Mountain temples\nMt. Shosha is at the northern edge of Himeji City and is home to Engyoji, a temple that has a history of over 1,000 years. The temple's lack of modern infrastructure means it is a common feature in period films; it appears in \"The Last Samurai.\" Despite its fringe location, the mountain is only 25 minutes away from the center of Himeji City by public transport.\nNot far away from Mt. Shosha is Mt. Seppiko, a collection of vertical rocky crags that attract rock climbers from across the Kansai region. The mountain is one of the Kinki 100 Famous Japanese mountains and has an excellent hiking trail to the top.\n### Museums for all ages\nHimeji has several museums which are well worth a visit such as the Himeji City Museum of Art, which hosts a permanent collection of a wide variety of Japanese and foreign artworks. Another popular museum is the Japan Toy Museum, which has a collection of over 90,000 items collected from Japan and around the world.\n### Nearby islands\nIeshima is a collection of 44 islands just off the coast of Himeji City in the Seto Inland Sea. Of the islands, just four are large enough to be inhabited, and of these, Ieshima is the largest.\nThe Ieshima Jukkei is a collection of ten scenic spots that can be found across the islands. Spots include the site of old castle ruins on Ieshima. The islands can be accessed by ferry from Himeji Port."}

There are also multiple ANA and Skymark Airlines flights between Tokyo's Haneda Airport and Kobe Airport. The cheapest way to get to Kobe is by overnight bus. There are a number of companies that offer the eight to nine-hour journey from Tokyo to the wider Osaka area, with prices varying from around 5,000 to 8,500 yen each way.\n### Quick Facts\nKobe is home to one of Japan's three Chinatown districts, Nankinmachi\nYou can eat world-famous Kobe beef\nIn 1995, the city was devastated by the Great Hanshin Earthquake\n### Home of the famous beef\nIf there's one dish that represents the city, it has to be Kobe beef. Coming from locally bred and raised Tajima cattle, this marbled, tender, and flavor-rich beef is internationally recognized and revered.\nThough there are a number of theories as to how the area produces such great beef, such as the cattle are massaged and given beer, this isn't actually the case. Instead, Kobe beef must meet a strict set of standards to ensure only the highest grade of beef is given the Kobe stamp of approval.\nThe most common way to enjoy Kobe beef here in the city is, of course, the classic steak. You can also try shabu shabu, where thin slices of meat are quickly dipped in boiling broth, or try sukiyaki, which is a hotpot style of cooking.\n### Checking out the night sights\nKobe's central location between the mountains and the sea offers you an eclectic collection of sightseeing and day trip opportunities.\nIf you are interested in getting a different perspective on the city, you can scale Kobe Port Tower, a 108-meter-high observation tower located on the city's waterfront between the Kobe Harborland entertainment and shopping district and Meriken Park. You can also take in what many consider Japan's best nighttime view by swinging up the Kobe-Nunobiki Ropeway, which scales the side of the Rokko mountain chain, to a breathtaking panorama of the city lights at night.\nFor a completely different view of the city, there's also lunch and dinner cruises that launch from Nakatottei Chuo Terminal on the bay.\n### Scenic walks and seaside parks\nKobe also boasts a number of impressive parks and waterfront hotspots. Check out the famous Sorakuen Garden, a traditional Japanese landscape garden in the middle of the city, or consider a 40-minute hike from Shin-Kobe Station up to the Kobe Nunobiki Herb Garden, passing Nunobiki Falls along the way.\n### Chinatown\nKobe is home to Nankinmachi, one of Japan's three main Chinatown districts, which offers plenty of street food and bubble tea. It is about a 5-minute walk from JR Motomachi Station.\n### Day trips\nThe city is also perfectly located for day trips to Osaka and beyond. Scale Mt. Rokko's 931-meter-tall peak to get a panoramic view of both Kobe and neighboring Osaka at once. Alternatively, visit Arima Onsen—one of Japan's oldest hot spring towns—to soak in the natural and healing waters.\n### The earthquake\nIn 1995, the city was devastated by the Great Hanshin Earthquake—also known as the Kobe Earthquake—which led to the death of 6,434 people. It also reportedly caused injury to more than 43,000 people and destroyed 100,000 homes. This magnitude 7.3 earthquake, and the destruction it left in its wake, has since shaped the city's identity.\nNumerous events and memorials are hosted across the city to remind visitors of what the city overcame and how to prevent any major future devastation. In 2002, the Kobe Earthquake Memorial Museum was opened to commemorate those lost in the tragedy and to educate about earthquake and disaster preparedness."}

Many aspects of Japanese culture originate from Kyoto and are deeply rooted in the lives of residents to this day. Tradition lives on through “machiya,” traditional wooden townhouses where residents spend modern lives today, yearly events unique to Kyoto like the famous Gion Matsuri, the culture of Kyoto's Hanamachi district where geisha live and work, and through Jizo statues (statues made of clay, bronze or stone that represent the guardian deity of children and travelers) found throughout the city. Kyoto's tradition adds color to everyday life through Japanese food – which is generally healthy and has good nutritional balance – as well as an appreciation for tea, and flower arrangements placed tastefully in open spaces. By experiencing this kaleidoscopic culture firsthand, travelers can enjoy a deeper perspective on Kyoto and its history.\nTo enjoy the charms that Kyoto has to offer, it's recommended to make use of less busy times to visit shrines – early in the morning, or late at night when they're lit up, for example. Additionally, you can divide Kyoto into a number of areas, complete with their own unique beauty and charm. In central Kyoto, there are a number of historic buildings and unforgettable pristine old townscapes for travelers to visit.\nThere are also a number of hidden gems unique to each region outside of central Kyoto. In northern Kyoto, the boundless natural beauty of the Keihoku and Miyama areas are complemented by a traditional Japanese countryside landscape. Further north in the region near the Sea of Japan, travelers can enjoy Amanohashidate's sandbar and Ine's boathouses. In southern Kyoto, visitors can taste traditional sake from Fushimi, which is one of Japan's three major sake brewery locations, as well as enjoy Japanese tea from Uji. To the west, visitors can experience the charm of Kyoto's bamboo forests and rural landscapes, as well as temples and shrines with deep histories in the Nishiyama Area. Unparalleled hidden gems await you outside of central Kyoto!\nWhen visiting Kyoto, it's best to keep in mind that many local residents call this ancient city home. To enjoy your trip to the fullest, please show consideration to local communities and mind your manners to help preserve Kyoto's culture and keep tourism sustainable moving forward.\nDue to Kyoto's increasing popularity, the city sometimes has an excessive concentration of tourists during particular times and seasons, or in certain areas – making life difficult for locals, and potentially damaging to natural environments.\nTo experience the quiet and serene beauty of Kyoto, make use of the Kyoto Travel Congestion Forecast map to check when popular spots are crowded, including live cameras to check how busy places are in real time. It's also recommended to visit popular temples in the early morning when they open, or to explore the other compelling areas outside of central Kyoto to help reduce crowds. In addition, taking advantage of Japan's trains and buses is a convenient way to get around the city. There are also a number of coin lockers and luggage storage facilities around rail stations that visitors can use. By leaving your luggage at these storage facilities, not only does it make it possible to enjoy Kyoto without needing to carry luggage around town, but it also helps reduce congestion on public transportation and makes space for more people to ride.\nWhen in the Gion and Higashiyama areas, you might see a “geiko” (geisha in Kyoto's dialect) or “maiko” (geisha in training) pass by. While you may be tempted to ask them for a photo, please refrain from stopping them and asking them for photos or touching their clothes since these lovely ladies are often in a hurry to get to their next appointment. If you'd like to get the chance to talk to a maiko or take pictures with them, consider booking a maiko experience or activity at Gion Corner instead. At Nishiki Market, while you may be tempted to enjoy your purchase while you explore the market, please eat any food at the store where it was purchased and dispose of the trash on site. As littering is strictly prohibited, it might be smart to bring a plastic bag for trash in case you can't find a trashcan nearby.\nThroughout Kyoto, be aware that smoking on the street is strictly prohibited, and there are penalties for smoking outside designated areas in the city center, including the Kiyomizu and Gion areas and around Kyoto Station. If you need to smoke, please find a designated smoking area first or you may be fined for smoking outdoors. Finally, please do not trespass onto private property, or interfere with residents' private lives, especially around Gion and the Ine boathouses. Local residents are sharing their community with visitors, so please show consideration to these communities and respect their spaces and property. (Click here for a message from Southern Gion)\n## How to Get There\nKyoto, a prime destination for most travelers, is easily accessible from Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, Fukuoka and other major cities via the Tokaido-Sanyo Shinkansen.\nThe nearest airports are Itami and Kansai International, both in Osaka Prefecture, and are located between 1 hour and 1.5 hours away, respectively.\nThanks to Kyoto Prefecture's vast transportation network, it's easy to uncover Kyoto's hidden charms, or visit the Another Kyoto area. The Ohara, Takao and Northern Kyoto areas are easily accessed by bus from Kyoto Station, and those looking to get to Miyama can take a bus from the Northern Kyoto area. The Yamashina Ward, Fushimi and Uji areas, as well as western Kyoto areas, are all accessible by train. To reach the Amanohashidate and Miyama areas, travelers will need to take the JR San'in Honsen Line, then change trains or use a bus, so it's recommended to plan in advance if you'd like to visit these areas.\n### Don’t Miss\n- Kyoto’s grand shrines, ancient castles and historical streets\n- Ohara’s crisp mountain air, stunning autumn foliage and symbolic gardens\n- Kyoto’s traditional Japanese inns, an essential convergence of Japanese tradition and culture\n- Kyoto cuisine, which perfectly encapsulates the Japanese spirit and art of food preparation\n- The four alternative views of Kyoto: Kyoto by the Sea, Woodland Kyoto, Tea Country Kyoto and Kyoto Otokuni Bamboo Groves\n## Explore Kyoto by Area\n- \\\\\nAround Kyoto Station & Southern Kyoto\n- \\\\\nGion & Higashiyama\n- \\\\\nCentral Kyoto\n- \\\\\nTakagamine & Murasakino\n- \\\\\nSagano & Arashiyama\n- \\\\\nOhara\n- \\\\\nKurama & Kifune\n- \\\\\nAnother Kyoto\n## Trending Attractions in Kyoto\n- gion & higashiyamagion & higashiyama\\\\\nKiyomizudera Temple\n- Shogunzuka Seiryuden Temple\\\\\nShogunzuka Seiryuden Temple\n- Kennin-ji\\\\\nKenninji Temple\n- Murin-an\\\\\nMurin-an Garden\n- Nishiki Market\\\\\nNishiki Market\n## Local Specialties\n- Yudofu\nYudofu, literally \"hot-water tofu\", is arguably the best way to enjoy high-quality, freshly made tofu. Tofu is warmed through in a simple broth made of water and kombu, and simple condiments are served alongside. Kyoto is the place to enjoy this, as it is the epicenter of Buddhist cuisine, in which yudofu features heavily.\n- Kyo-Gashi\nKyo-gashi are a type of wagashi, or traditional Japanese sweet. Kyo-gashi are beautiful, colorful and symbolic confections, custom-made for different occasions, so no Kyo-gashi will ever be exactly the same as another.\n- Kyo-Yasai\nBefore modern transportation was available, farmers grew only the vegetables most suited to the regions they farmed in. Kyo-yasai are vegetables traditionally grown in Kyoto for centuries, and they play an important role in modern Kyoto cuisine.\n- Uji Tea\nGreen tea from Uji is among the oldest and most highly regarded teas in Japan. You'll find it in tiny soba restaurants and temple gardens and many places in between. There are a variety of ways to enjoy green tea while in Uji.\n- Kyoto Kiyomizu Ware\nHandmade ceramics and porcelain made in Kyoto are known as kyo yaki or Kiyomizu yaki and are characterized by their gorgeous elegance made with advanced pottery techniques. This craft evolved alongside other sophisticated pastimes in Kyoto, including the tea ceremony and flower arranging.\n- Kyoto Dyed Silk\nInvented in the late 17th century, kyo yuzen is a dyeing technique distinguished by vivid colors, subtle gradations, complex patterns and precision linework. Traditional Japanese painting-like patterns are expressed in the textile design.\n- Nishijin Textiles\nNishijin ori silk textiles originate in Nishijin, the garment district of Kyoto. Exquisitely decorated brocades have been handwoven here for centuries, and feature gorgeous patterns utilizing multi-colored yarn-dyed threads. Treated with care, these garments can last a lifetime.\n- Kyoto Folding Fans\nFashioned out of bamboo, the kyo sensu is a folding fan decorated with handmade Japanese paper or silk on thin wooden strips, traditionally cypress. These artful accessories are used at ceremonies, festivals and Noh performances.\n## Seasonal Highlights\n- Spring\nLate April to May is the time to view late-blooming cherry blossoms, yaezakura (double-flowered cherry blossoms) and the fresh green maple leaves in shrine and temple gardens.\n- Summer\nHighlights of the hottest season include riverside dining, cormorant fishing performances, beach excursions, the month-long Gion Festival, and fire displays to honor the spirits of ancestors.\n- Autumn\nKyoto’s autumn foliage attracts visitors from the world over. Harvest moon festivals are another autumn highlight. The cool temperatures are perfect for hiking at Mt. Ponpon and Mt. Atago.\n- Winter\nKabuki’s biggest stars come to perform, plum blossoms emerge after the snows, and countryside onsen offer plenty of warmth."}

Kyoto's culture was created by bringing together different materials and techniques from the surrounding environments. For example, vegetables used in Kyoto cuisine are procured from forests like Kameoka City, while the tea leaves used to make the city's famous green tea and matcha are grown in southern Kyoto, and is a specialty of areas like Uji City and Wazuka Town. Travelers to Japan looking to experience the profound charm of Kyoto will want to explore the four areas we've listed as “Another Kyoto” – Kyoto by the Sea, Woodland Kyoto, Kyoto Tea Country and Kyoto Otokuni Bamboo Grove.\n### Don't Miss\n- Take a leisurely stroll along the Sea of Japan on Amanohashidate's pine forest and sandbar in Miyazu Bay and experience Kyoto by the sea\n- Embark on a riverboat ride down the Hozu River in Kameoka City\n- Deepen your appreciation for Japanese tea and savor matcha in many forms in Uji City\n- Enjoy an idyllic walk amongst the bamboo trees in Muko City\n## How to Get There\nTravelers looking to explore Kyoto by the Sea can start their journey at Amanohashidate Station, which is about 130 minutes away from Kyoto Station.

Also in the Miyazu region, visitors will find Nariaiji Temple, one of the 33 temples visited along the Kansai Kannon Pilgrimage route. The serene village of Ine includes around 230 “ funaya” (boat houses) sitting right on the water, painting a picturesque scene. Visitors seeking sandy beaches and ocean waves can explore the shallow and tranquil waters of Tomari Beach in Ine, or experience the enchanting beauty of Yuhigaura Beach in the Kyotango region, complete with a driftwood swing and breathtaking sunsets.

Uji City, home to Byodoin Temple and the Uji Bridge, was the location of many aristocratic vacation homes since ancient times. As a result, the culture and industry of the region developed in line with the tastes of the upper class. Visitors to Uji City can deepen their appreciation for all things matcha and green tea, from traditional matcha soba and “cha-dango” (a sweet dumpling flavored with matcha) to contemporary delights such as matcha ice cream and matcha beer. Some shops in the area offer visitors the chance to grind their own matcha and enjoy a small tea ceremony using the freshly ground powder. For visitors interested in visiting a green tea farm, Wazuka is home to several ideal locations. In addition to being able to partake in tea picking experiences depending on the season, visitors can learn about different types of tea and their agricultural production cycles.\n### Kyoto Otokuni Bamboo Groves\nThe Kyoto Otokuni Bamboo Grove area, spread across Muko City, Nagaokakyo City and Oyamazaki Town in western Kyoto, is known for its beautiful bamboo groves and production of high-quality bamboo shoots. Take-no-Michi (“The Bamboo Path”) in Muko City is a hidden gem that gives visitors an intimate experience amongst towering bamboo. Roughly five times the size of Arashiyama and spanning a total of 1.8 kilometers, Take-no-Michi's bamboo path is lined with eight different kinds of bamboo hedges. Here, visitors can enjoy a stroll through an enchanting bamboo forest without worrying about crowds.\nThere's certainly more to Kyoto Otokuni Bamboo Groves than just admiring the bamboo. Visitors can enjoy sweets or kaiseki cuisine featuring bamboo shoots, or try their hand at making traditional bamboo crafts like tea scoops and bamboo baskets."}

It is now home to some of Japan's most popular attractions. Many of these attractions, including Kyoto Gosho and Nijo Castle, are located right in the heart of the city. You can spend several hours exploring the center of Kyoto and see some of Japan's most iconic heritage sites.\n©Nijo Castle Office\n### Don't Miss\n- The grand, feudal-era Nijo Castle\n- Kyoto Gosho and the spacious park that surrounds it\n- Shimogamo-jinja Shrine, one of Kyoto's oldest shrines\n- The traditional atmosphere of the Nishijin Textile District\n## How to Get There\nCentral Kyoto is easily accessed by train or bus from Kyoto Station.\nMost of Central Kyoto is accessed conveniently by the Kyoto Municipal Subway Karasuma Line or the private railway Keihan Line from Kyoto Station. To visit Kyoto Gosho, Kyoto Goen and Sento Gosho parks from Kyoto Station, take the Karasuma Line to Marutamachi or Imadegawa Station. To get to Nijo Castle from Kyoto Station, take the Karasuma Line to Karasuma-Oike Station. Switch to the Kyoto Municipal Subway Tozai Line and get off at Nijo-jo-mae Station. Shimogamo-jinja Shrine is on the Keihan Line toward Demachiyanagi Station. It's a 10-minute walk from there. The Nishijin District is best accessed by bus. From Kyoto Station, take the number 9 bus to Horikawa Imadegawa bus stop.\n©Nijo Castle Office\n### A show of power at Nijo Castle\nThe first Tokugawa shogun, Ieyasu, had this extravagant complex built in 1603. He intentionally built close to the Imperial Palace as an expression of his power, and to protect the Emperor.\nThe elaborate gilded architectural detail of Nijo Castle is in stark contrast to the bare minimalism of the Imperial Palace; the castle is covered in intricate wood carvings and extravagantly painted panels, and features double moats and a high wall for protection. One fascinating feature is the \"nightingale\" floors, named for the birdlike sound they emit when you walk across them. This was an ancient security system, alerting guards to intruders.\nThe huge palace complex is comprised of five main buildings, all with numerous chambers. You can peek your head into these and see the impressive screen paintings by famed artists Kano Tanyu and Naonobu. The grounds contain a spectacular example of a traditional Japanese landscape garden as well as an ornamental plum orchard and many maples that turn brilliant hues in autumn.\n©Nijo Castle Office\n### The regal Kyoto Gosho\nKyoto Gosho is the former residence of the Japanese imperial family. It has been vacant since 1868 when the capital moved from Kyoto to Tokyo.\nThe palace you see today is surrounded by a high wall on all sides and within its grounds the historic architecture of Kyoto can be seen.\nGuided tours and access to the interiors of the buildings can be applied for at the Imperial Household Office inside the Imperial Palace Park, or directly in front of the palace buildings.\n### Kyoto Gyoen and Sento Gosho\nThe Imperial Palace and the Sento Gosho palace grounds are both located within the grounds of Kyoto Gyoen.\nDuring the Edo period (1603-1867), emperors came to Sento Gosho to relax. Only two buildings remain, but the garden is splendid in its own right. It features a walled garden dotted with serene ponds. Well-trodden pathways meander past magnificent trees and an array of impressive plants and flowers. Sento Gosho is accessible only by guided tour. You can apply for the tour in front of the palace.\nThe Kyoto State Guest House is also open to the public and is to the east of the Gosho.\nKyoto's answer to New York's Central Park, Kyoto Gyoen is an oasis within the city and is perfect for an afternoon stroll. It's a great spot to people-watch, as locals come here to jog or have a picnic. No application is necessary to enter Kyoto Gyoen, which surrounds Kyoto's Imperial Palace.\nKyoto Gyoen has some good flora to see. A plum grove blooms in early March and a grove of weeping cherry trees bloom a bit earlier in the spring.\n### Warding off evil at Shimogamo-jinja\nDating back to the sixth century, Shimogamo-jinja Shrine is one of Japan's oldest and most important shrines and is a designated UNESCO World Heritage site. Together with Kamigamo-jinja Shrine, it is one-half of the pair of Kamo Shrines built to protect Kyoto from evil.\nShimogamo-jinja is one of Kyoto's most sophisticated shrines, with splendidly detailed architecture. The complex includes many small shrines in a beautiful setting in the northeastern part of Central Kyoto, tucked within a large forest that contains 600-year-old trees. Many events are held at Shimogawa-jinja, most importantly the Aoi Matsuri held in May, one of Kyoto's three great festivals.\n### Traditional textiles in Nishijin District\nThe traditional textile district of Kyoto, Nishijin, is in the northwest of central Kyoto. Come here to learn about the history of Japanese textiles and to wander the historic streets lined with old wooden houses, or machiya, and dotted with small temples.\nVisit the Nishijin Textile Center to learn more about the ancient art of weaving. A workshop-museum hybrid, it's a great way to see some truly remarkable kimono first-hand.\nThe center also features live weaving demonstrations and a gallery of extravagant kimono from long ago.\nHands-on activities include weaving classes and the chance to dress up in a kimono and get your photo taken and/or stroll the streets of Kyoto in style.\nYou can also visit the Orinasukan, a somewhat smaller, quieter museum. Here you can find exhibits on the history of the area as well as live weaving demonstrations. There are some truly remarkable Japanese textiles on display, including some intricate Noh theater costumes."}

The area is also home to several of the city's kagai, or geisha districts.\n### Don't Miss\n- Spotting an elusive geisha, called geiko in Kyoto\n- Taking a leisurely morning stroll down the Philosopher's Path\n- Scouring the quaint shops in the Gojo area for locally-made ceramics and other crafts\n- Observing the city from the incredible wooden stage at Kiyomizu-dera Temple\n## How to Get There\nGion and Higashiyama cover a wide area that is now the heart and soul of Kyoto. It is easily accessed by public transportation. Within the district, most sites are a leisurely walk away.\nFrom Kyoto Station take the no. 5 or 100 bus for Silver Pavilion (Ginkakuji Temple) and the northern end of the Philosopher's Path. This journey takes about 40 minutes. Take the no. 100 and 206 buses for Kiyomizu-michi, the nearest stop to Kiyomizu-dera Temple. This journey takes about 20 minutes.\nGion-Shijo and Kiyomizu-Gojo stations on the Keihan Line offer easy access to Shijo and Gojo streets. You can Gion and Kiyomizu within 15 minutes by walking eastwards along these streets.\nKiyomizu-dera\n### The Silver Pavilion—the center of Higashiyama culture\nKyoto experienced a cultural renaissance under the 15th century shogun Yoshimasa, who built the exquisite Ginkakuji Temple, nicknamed the Silver Pavilion (though never actually covered in silver) and now a UNESCO World Heritage site. Here the traditional arts, from tea to ikebana flower arranging, flourished under his patronage. The temple garden, which was completed after Yoshimasa's death in 1490, is famous for its moss and autumn colors, though it is gorgeous the year round.\nGinkaku-ji, The Silver Pavillion\n### Enjoy a contemplative stroll along the Philosopher's Path\nRunning along the foot of the Eastern Hills is a cherry tree-lined canal and trail, known today as the Philosopher's Path. There are some nice little craft shops and cafes to relax at along the way. While usually tranquil, at the peak of the cherry blossoms season this route can be very crowded, so it is best to start early during that time of year.\nSummer greenery along the Philosopher's Path\nFollow the Philosopher's Path southbound for about 30 minutes from Silver Pavilion (Ginkakuji Temple), and you will pass numerous temples including Eikando, a prime autumn foliage-viewing spot, before reaching the massive Nanzenji Temple complex. This was once the country's most important temple, and you may well recognize the enormous Sanmon Gate from the Hollywood blockbuster \"Lost in Translation.\" The sub temple of Tenju-an is also highly recommended. The Murin-an gardens are a calm and tranquil place not too far away.\nNanzenji Temple\n### Discover the old and new of Gion\nFurther south, towards Shijo Street, you begin to enter Gion. Here you can find the ochaya, wooden teahouses, that serve as the residences and reception venues for geisha, though some have been converted into high-end restaurants and bars that are open to the public.\nShinbashi Street is especially picturesque. Furumonzen and Shinmonzen streets close by are home to a cluster of antique shops.\nShijo Street itself is a lively and modern entertainment area, with abundant opportunities to shop for souvenirs and eat your fill of green tea-flavored sweets. Strolling through the Yasaka-jinja Shrine grounds on the far eastern end, you can continue on through the pleasant Maruyama Park to Chionin and Shorenin temples.\nKodaiji Temple is also easily accessible from here and holds interesting night-time exhibitions and light-up events through the year.\nIf you wish to continue your pursuit of geisha, follow Hanamikoji Street southbound to Gion Kobu Kaburenjo Theater. In normal circumstances visitors can also watch the maiko (apprentice geisha) perform, as well as other traditional Japanese arts.\nA stone's throw away is Kenninji Temple, the oldest Zen temple in Kyoto.\n### Shop for local crafts and ceramics in the Kiyomizu area\nThe Kiyomizu area is heaven for ceramics lovers and is host to numerous pottery shops.\nKawai Kanjiro Memorial House, the former residence of a mingei potter, is a hidden gem in the area.\nKiyomizudera Temple is a must-see, though prepare to walk uphill and brave crowds to reach it.\nGion and Higashiyama is a district filled with many of the sites and sights that are the very reason that people flock to Kyoto. You should expect to spend a whole day here, at least, or risk feeling rushed. Two days and an evening are recommended."}

Temples with mysterious origins, a mystical history, lush cedar forests, and an easy day hike are all at your fingertips.\n### Don't Miss\n- The mountain dwelling Kuramadera Temple\n- Up and over the mountain on the Kurama-Kibune hike\n## How to Get There\nThe Kurama area is accessible by train and bus from Kyoto Station.\nTake the Kyoto Municipal Karasuma Line to Kokusai Kaikan, and from the Kokusai Kaikan-mae bus stop take the Kyoto Bus No. 52 bound for Kurama Onsen. Get off at Kurama.\n### A mystical land\nMt. Kurama is known for being the birthplace of reiki, a holistic healing art started in the early 1900s and still practiced widely today. Mt. Kurama has a history steeped in mystical beliefs.\n### Protected by tengu\nIt is believed that tengu, mythical creatures from Japanese folklore, still haunt the area. Once believed to be evil, they are now seen as protectors of the natural world. Thought to be both kami and yokai—divine spirit and ghost—tengu are depicted with both human and bird-like characteristics.\nOutside of Kurama station you will be greeted by an enormous statue of Sojobo, king of the Tengu, said to have originated in Kurama.\n### The esoteric history of Kuramadera Temple\nKuramadera is the main temple of the area, sprawling down one side of Mt. Kurama.\nThe temple was founded in the eighth century, but its origins are mysterious. It is said that a monk traveled to Kurama after learning of its mystical powers in a dream. He built Kuramadera to harness the unique spiritual power of the area. Although it was controlled by various Buddhist sects throughout the ages, it is dedicated to esoteric beliefs and mountain worship today.\n### Hike or ride up to a grand view\nYou can pay 200 yen to take a short cable car up the mountain to reach the main building. If you'd like a more intimate look at the complex, you can hike up the mountain path.\nAt the top, the mountain is elevated, and buildings stand in a vast courtyard. The view of the mountains and valleys beyond is amazing.\n### The Kurama-Kibune hike\nPast the main hall, a trail continues up and over the mountain to Kibune on the opposite side of the mountain. The hike is lovely, and leads to a few smaller temples that are part of Kuramadera.\n### Exposed roots\nHalfway through the hike, you'll encounter a special grove of trees. Their roots are unable to penetrate the hard ground and have woven together in a mesmerizing pattern.\n### A satisfying journey\nIf you include the walk from the base of the temple, the hike to Kibune is 3.9 km and takes about two to three hours. It's not too difficult, and includes wooden steps and handrails in more difficult areas both ascending and descending the mountain. Come in August, when it's not as hot as the city, or autumn, when the trees are at their best.\n### Kifune-jinja Shrine and Kibune\nOnce in Kibune, you should continue your mountain pilgrimage and visit Kifune-jinja. It's hard to miss the entrance to Kifune-jinja: a long stone staircase lined with red lanterns. The sight is absolutely stunning in any season.\nThe shrine is dedicated to the god of water and features a special omikuji (fortune) that can be floated on the water. At first it appears blank, but once placed on the water of the shrine's fountain, your fortune magically appears.\n### Dine on kawadoko\nKibune is a fantastic area and worth a closer look. Local Kyoto people would come to Kibune to escape the heat of the city. It's known for the kawadoko, or decks, that are built over the Kibune river, and are a natural form of air-conditioning. During the summer, you can enjoy a traditional Japanese meal atop a kawadoko, a truly unique experience.\nThe Kurama area offers many more attractive places and events. Day trips are possible from downtown Kyoto, but an overnight stay may be a good option for hikers."}

In addition to its wonderful temples, it is a popular spot for autumn leaves, which burst into color about one week earlier than the rest of Kyoto, and for cherry blossoms and azaleas in the spring.\n### Don't Miss\n- Sanzenin, a temple with deep ties to the Imperial family\n- Jikkoin, a strong influence on Japan's musical traditions\n- Jakkoin, a nunnery since 1186\n## How to Get There\nThe Ohara Area is accessible from JR Kyoto Station by bus.\nFrom Kyoto Station, you can catch bus no. 17 to Ohara. It's a 40-minute ride to Ohara.\n### Enchanting origins\nOhara is known as the center of shomyo, a Buddhist chanting style associated with the Tendai sect of Buddhism. Shomyo was brought to the area by the monk Ennin (794-864), who had studied the technique in China, although it originated in India.\n### A little about Tendai Buddhism\nTendai Buddhism in Japan is based on a Chinese school of Buddhism of the same name. In Japan, Tendai Buddhism was arguably the most important and influential of the many schools of Buddhism. Its universal world view allowed for the reconciliation of Buddhist teachings and Shinto. In addition, most of the founders of new schools of Buddhism in Japan were originally trained in Tendai Buddhism. Tendai had very close ties with the Imperial family, and with the Tokugawa shogunate. The headquarters of Tendai is Enryakuji on Mt. Hiei in Kyoto.\n### A quaint village\nThe town of Ohara is charming, the locals are friendly, and you can find many small shops offering local specialties and crafts. There are a few ryokan, complete with onsen, available if you wish to prolong your stay in this tranquil mountainside village.\n### Sanzenin\nSanzenin Temple is the town's most famous site. A street of the town leads directly to it, tucked away in the eastern mountains.\nSurrounded by towering stone walls, Sanzenin is a large temple complex with many impressive buildings and beautiful gardens. The well-known monk Saicho (767-822), responsible for the founding of the Tendai sect of Buddhism, established the temple in the early Heian Period (794-1185).\nSanzenin is surrounded by many smaller temples, most belonging to the Tendai sect. A lovely walking trail through the mountains connects them, eventually leading to the scenic Otonashi Waterfall.\n### Jikkoin\nA short walk from Sanzenin is Jikkoin Temple. Originally the monk's quarters for nearby Shorin-in Temple, Jikkoin now stands alone as an impressive temple.\nThe guest hall features bells and other instruments used in Shomyo music.\n### Symbolic gardens\nJikkoin is known for its two gardens. Keishin-en Garden has a koi pond in which each of its natural features represents a different Buddhist symbol.\nBelow the temple is a stroll garden with a pond, tea house, stone lanterns and small stone pagodas. The garden is known for its autumn-blooming cherry trees, which afford visitors the unique opportunity of viewing cherry blossoms and autumn foliage together.\nThe temple is generally quiet, as few guests visit except in the fall. You can sit here and enjoy a cup of matcha with Japanese sweets, and bask in the serenity.\n### Jakko-in\nJakko-in Temple is also of the Tendai sect. Although it dates back more than a thousand years, the main hall was lost in 2000 to arson and rebuilt in 2005.\nJakko-in is known for its picturesque stairway leading to the front gate. Interestingly, this temple was also once a nunnery where a former empress studied.\nWhile here, visit the art gallery, which has an impressive collection of calligraphy scrolls and ancient Japanese paintings.\nOhara offers visitors a chance to see real rural Japan without an arduous trek. It makes for a peaceful and soothing day trip."}

Saihoji Temple next door is famous for its moss garden, resplendent with 120 types of beautiful moss (reservation required).\n### Japan's most precious imperial villa\nRakusai's main attraction is certainly Katsura Imperial Villa, a world-famous villa featuring a simple but functional architectural style. Several teahouses dot the grounds, interconnected by a foot path that winds through what many consider to be Japan's most beautiful garden. You can only explore the grounds as part of a guided tour."}

The famed Nishijin weaving district is still a thriving center of crafts, and is a great spot to immerse yourself in ancient Kyoto. Although not as well-known as the city's other places of worship, the temples in this area are famous for their connection to the arts.\n### Don't Miss\n- The quiet grounds of Murasakino's lesser-known temples\n- The grave of Tale of Genji author Murasaki Shikibu\n- The Omiya and Shinmachi shopping streets, not far from Daitokuji Temple\n## How to Get There\nThese districts are accessible by train and bus from Kyoto Station.\nFrom Kyoto Station, northern Kyoto (where Takagamine and Murasakino are located) is most easily accessed by train via the Kyoto Municipal Subway. Takagamine and Murasakino are a short walk west of Kita-Oji Subway Station on the Karasuma Line. Kita-Oji is just seven stops from Kyoto Station.\nMany buses stop in these districts. The bus may be more convenient if you are going from another less central location.\n### In the name of history\nTakagamine means \"Peak of the Hawk,\" and got its name because this area once served as the Imperial hunting grounds when falconry was a popular sport among the nobility.\nThe name of the neighboring district, Murasakino, has a similar genesis. Murasaki in Japanese means “purple,” and Murasaki Shikibu, author of The Tale of Genji—the world's oldest extant novel—is buried in the district. Murasakino remains a vibrant neighborhood of old shopping arcades and lively festivals.\n### The birthplace of warrior Zen\nDaitokuji Temple is the largest of Murasakino's many temples, with two dozen sub-temples within its vast grounds. As the center of the tea ceremony, the temple has a wealth of teahouses, Japanese gardens, graves of former warlords, famous fusuma (sliding door) paintings, and other historical sites and cultural assets.\n### Weaving a tale of textiles, history and culture\nThe Nishijin district offers you both the ambiance of ancient Kyoto and insights into the crafts and culture that the city is so well known for. At the Nishijin Textile Center and Orinasukan, for example, you can explore the realm of fine textiles. There are museums and galleries devoted to the weaving arts as well.\nThe Urasenke Chado Research Center is the place to learn about Japan's culture of tea, in the city that claims to be the heart of it all.\n### A microcosm of stone and sand\nDaitokuji's most popular sub-temple is Daisenin, whose gardens have inspired garden designers for centuries. This sub-temple offers weekend zazen meditation sessions for those who want to ponder life and the garden more deeply.\n### Ensuring security against illness\nDaitokuji Temple is Imamiya-jinja Shrine, where locals offer prayers for protection from epidemic diseases. The shrine hosts the Yasurai Festival in spring, which features a parade where red and black demons dance to the music of flutes and drums. According to legend, if you walk under the Furyu-gasa—an elegant umbrella adorned with flowers and grass for the festival—you'll stay healthy for the entire year.\n### A tale of two temples\nKoetsuji Temple in Takagamine was once the residence of Honami Koetsu, a very famous Japanese cultural giant, expert in calligraphy, ceramic art, gold lacquerware and the tea ceremony in the 17th century.\nNot far away is Genkoan, a temple built in the mid-14th century, famous for its square and round windows overlooking the gardens. The floorboards used for the ceiling of the temple's main hall have a dark history: when Fushimi Castle fell in 1600, the lord and his family committed suicide, leaving their bloodstains on the floorboards.\nBoth temples sit high on a rise above Kyoto, so their gardens offer fantastic views of the city below.\n### The art of the Korean Peninsula\nThe area's most unusual attraction is likely the Koryo Museum, a collection of 1,700 works of art from the Korean Peninsula assembled by a former pachinko and izakaya magnate. This is Japan's only museum dedicated to the art of the Korean Peninsula, and includes folk art, paintings, bronze works, pottery and furniture the founder collected from all over Japan."}

Many of these sites have cultivated flower gardens that enhance their surroundings. Nara Park is home to the famously tame deer wandering freely, and adjacent Todaiji Temple houses the world's largest bronze Buddha statue. Important pilgrimage routes run through the Mt. Yoshino area, a World Heritage site and stunning cherry blossom spot in the spring.\n## How to Get There\nYou can reach Nara easily from either Osaka or Kyoto, the key transit points for a visit to the prefecture. The nearest airports are Osaka International (Itami) Airport and Kansai International Airport, both located in Osaka Prefecture, approximately an hour and 15 minutes by bus and train.\nThe sights at Nara Park and Naramachi are accessible from both Nara Station and Kintetsu Nara Station. A bus will get you to the sites of Heijo Palace and Horyuji Temple.

Its ties to Japan's ancient past provide a sense of wonder, and it is a great place to discover by bicycle.\nThe sweeping scenery and rich history of the Asuka area are great if you enjoy being outdoors or examining art and artifacts. Large monoliths and carved stones are scattered across the area, and other objects have been gathered for the study of times long past.\n### Don't Miss\n- Mysterious stones and burial mounds\n- Asuka Historical Museum\n- A perfectly preserved Edo period (1603-1867) town\n## How to Get There\nAccess to Asuka Station is from either Kyoto Station or Nara Station. It takes around one hour from either of the two cities.\nFrom Kyoto Station, take the Kintetsu Kyoto Line to Kashihara-jingu-mae Station. Transfer there to Kintetsu Yoshino Line. Asuka Station is just four minutes away.\nFrom Nara Station, it is a short walk to Kintetsu Railways. Take the Kintetsu Yoshino Line to Kashihara-jingu-mae Station. Transfer there to Kintetsu Yoshino Line. Asuka Station is just four minutes away from there.\n### Ancient history preserved\nThe Asuka area contains the first temples, shrines, tombs, and stone monuments of Japan. Although it is not the most well-known of Japan's capitals, it was one of the first, serving as the political, artistic, and religious center of Japan during the 5th and 6th centuries.\nThis was a time of great change in Japan. It was here, in the Kashihara area, that the first emperor is thought to have taken the throne. During the Asuka period (538-710) Buddhism arrived from China, bringing with it many other cultural innovations. This period marked the first time that Japan functioned as a unified national state.\nAsuka's roots go even deeper than the historical era that bears its name, back to the Kofun, or Old Mound period (250-552). This era gets its name from the burial practice of large, key-shaped earthen mounds surrounded by moats.\n### Enter the tomb of an influential noble\nBurial mounds still dot the landscape in this area. Some of them are known to be graves of important figures from the region. One of these is known as Ishibutai Burial Mound, or the Stone Stage. Here you have the chance to go inside this massive structure and get a view of the stonework buried beneath the ground.\nTakamatsuzaka Kofun is probably the most famous of these burial mounds. No one knows exactly who was laid to rest in this tomb. During its first excavation in the 1970s, a colored mural was found. You can see a replica at Takamatsuzaka Mural Hall while the original is being studied and restored.\n### Visit mysterious stone structures\nThere are over 200 large stone figures in the area, many of which remain in their original locations. They can be toured by (rental) bicycle. Doing so is a great way to enjoy the rural scenery, which is accented in both spring and fall by wildflowers growing along the roads.\nThe artists that created these stones and their functions have been lost to history. Each stone takes a different shape and style. Looking at them, you can't help but wonder about the people who labored with primitive tools to create these sculptures that have outlived them by more than a millennium.\nSome of the structures you can see are a large stone in the shape of a turtle, called kameishi; a set of four stones carved into the shape of monkeys, called saruishi; and a set of stoneworks including the figures of a coin and a tortoise.\nThere are also more abstract symbols like the sake trough, or sakefuneishi, made of carved lines and pools in a flat, table-shaped rock.\n### Collections of art and artifacts\nThe Nara National Research Institute for Cultural Properties, or Asuka Historical Museum, strives to help people understand these distant times. It focuses on artifacts from the Asuka period.\nThe collection of the Archaeological Institute of Kashihara displays artifacts from even earlier times, ranging from prehistoric ages to the 3rd century AD.\n### The origins of Japanese Buddhism in a modest temple\nAsukadera is one of the oldest temples in Japan, first built around 596. The main buildings were moved to Nara City when the capital was relocated there. The current buildings were set in a nearby location between the 17th and 18th centuries. But this temple still has its original bronze statue of Buddha—the oldest in Japan.\n### An authentic Edo period town\nYou can find a slightly more recent history in Asuka, too. Imaicho, in Kashihara City, is home to the largest neighborhood of authentic Edo period (1603-1867) buildings in Japan. Stroll through the streets and appreciate the atmosphere of bygone days.\nWhile a history buff can easily spend a whole day here, casual travelers should plan to spend several hours at least, to enjoy the rural landscape and experience the 1,700 years of history and culture."}

Some are carefully cultivated, but many grow naturally on the fields and hillsides. Hikers from all over Japan and abroad come here to enjoy the ever-changing views.\nThis region's beauty is combined with a long and rich history. The area was an ancient center of politics, art, and culture, and it was here that Buddhism first took root in Japan. The traditional sport of sumo has roots here in Katsuragi. The shrines and temples celebrate both the history and the floral beauty of the region.\n### Don't Miss\n- Experience sumo in an authentic ring\n- View the many varieties of flowering trees at Taimadera Temple\n- See the 1,000-year-old gingko tree in Katsuragi Hitokotonushi-jinja Shrine\n## How to Get There\nKatsuragi is located on the west side of Nara Prefecture. It is accessible from Kyoto via a limited express train which takes around 90 minutes. From Osaka it takes around one hour. From Tokyo the journey is around three hours.\nFrom Tokyo, take the JR Tokaido Shinkansen to Shin-Osaka Station. At Shin-Osaka Station, transfer to the Midosuji Subway Line to Tennoji Station. From Abenobashi (Tennoji) it is around 45 minutes to Taima-dera Station by Kintetsu Minami-Osaka Line.\nFrom Kyoto, take the Kintetsu Kyoto/Kashihara Line and transfer at Kashihara-jingu-mae Station. After this it will take 15 minutes to Taima-dera Station by Kintetsu Minami-Osaka Line.\n### View seasonal blossoms from a mountain summit\nThe most visible landmark in the area is Mt. Katsuragi, a 950-meter-tall mountain that straddles the border of Nara and Osaka prefectures. It is home to a wide variety of flowers that bloom throughout the year.\nThe most popular of these is the rhododendron. There are thought to be more than one million of them in bloom every May, and this season is filled with hikers coming to enjoy the sea of red blossoms.\nFall is another popular time for hiking, with Japanese silver grass, regionally known as susuki, covering the hills. If hiking up a mountain is more than you are ready to take on, there is a ropeway that offers aerial views.\n### Significant in mythical and real history\nLike neighboring Nara and Asuka, Katsuragi is connected to some of the most ancient historical sites in Japan. It is named for the Katsuragi clan, an important family who lived in this area during the Kofun period, from the 3rd to the 5th century.\nKatsuragi is thought by some to be the real-life location of a mythical place, Takaamahara. According to Kojiki, the earliest historical record in Japan dating back to 711-712, Takaamahara was home to the gods.\n### Flower temples with historical roots\nThe temples in Katsuragi have a very long history, dating back almost to the arrival of Buddhism in Japan. Taimadera Temple was founded in 612. Its temple bell and stone lanterns are the oldest in Japan.\nThe grounds of Taimadera are covered with plum and cherry trees. This means that spring blossom season here can last months instead of weeks. But really, the gardens of this temple are beautiful at any season.\nAnother ancient temple nearby is Sekkoji Temple. It is located at the base of Mt. Nijo. It was built in the early 7th century and is home to the oldest stone Buddhas in Japan.\nLike Taimadera Temple, Sekkoji is known for its flowers, but especially for peony trees, of which it boasts more than 4,000. They typically bloom from late April to early May.\n### One word, one wish\nA Shinto shrine, Katsuragi Hitokotonushi-jinja Shrine, is dedicated to the god of that name, who is said to grant any wish, as long as it is only one word long. When you visit, be sure to think carefully and prepare your wish beforehand.\nA gingko tree in the shrine is believed to be over 1,200 years old. This tree has an unusual name, the breast tree, because of its unique shape. It is revered by women hoping to give birth and raise healthy children.\n### Experience Sumo in a realistic ring\nOn a different historical note, Katsuragi is considered to be the birthplace of sumo wrestling. A small museum, the Sumo-kan \"Kehaya-za,\" was opened in 1990 to arouse interest and help people understand this traditional sport. Some exhibits are interactive, and demonstrations are occasionally available.\nYou should plan to spend around three hours to see all of the main sites of the Katsuragi area, including the walks between locations. During spring, hiking may require additional time due to the crowds of flower-gazers."}

Ikoma and Mt. Shigi\n## How to Get There\nNara City is located east of Osaka City and south of Kyoto City and easily accessed by train from both. The city is served by two main stations – JR Nara Station and Kintetsu Nara Station – offering convenient connections depending on your route.\nFrom Osaka, the JR Yamatoji Rapid Service goes directly to JR Nara Station.\nFrom Kyoto, the JR Miyakoji Rapid Service goes directly to JR Nara Station.\nFrom other locations in Kyoto or Osaka, the Kintetsu private railway may be the most convenient alternative.\n## Nara Highlights\n### Visit the world's oldest wooden structures\nThe Ikaruga area near Nara City is home to Horyuji Temple, the world's oldest wooden building. Also worth a visit is the nearby Hokiji Temple, with its magnificent three-story pagoda. Both are UNESCO World Heritage Sites, packed with historical intrigue.\nAccess: Take the JR Yamatoji Line from JR Nara Station to Horyuji Station (10 minutes), then walk or take a bus from the station.\n### Explore Nara's Ancient Buddhist Heritage\nClose to central Nara is the site of what was once the most important building in Japan, Heijo Palace. Although little remains of the original structures, the buildings at the Heijo Palace site have been recreated using authentic period-appropriate materials.\nAccess: Take the Kintetsu-Nara Line from Kintetsu Nara Station to Yamato-Saidaiji Station, then walk for 20 minutes.\nThe only surviving part of the original palace is found at the nearby 8th century Toshodaiji . The simple, ancient buildings are architectural gems. Fans of historical architecture should also visit Yakushiji, which has an ancient pagoda dating back to A.D. 730.\n### Find Tranquility in Nara's Quiet Corner of Temple Heritage\nNear to this is the Saidaiji area. The two largest temples in this area are Akishino Temple, known for its peaceful moss garden, and Saidaiji, one of the Nanto Shichi Daiji, literally \"the seven great temples of the southern capital” (a.k.a. Nara).\nAccess: Take the Kintetsu Nara Line bus from Yamato-Saidaiji Station to Akishinodera Temple bus stop (5 minutes).\n## Is it worth travelling beyond central Nara?\nVisitors who are willing to travel a little further outside of the city will enjoy the Yamatokoriyama area. This area is only a short distance from sights such as Yakushiji and can be combined with them in a day trip.\nThe area is known for the spectacular Koriyama Castle. This castle is famous for its peaceful garden and its stone wall, which features stones from a variety of sources.\nThe defensive structure serves as a powerful reminder of Japan's military past. Yamatokoriyama is the center of the Japanese goldfish industry, and there is even a Goldfish Museum.\nAccess: Take the Kintetsu Kashihara Line from Kintetsu Nara Station to Kintetsu-Koriyama Station, or the JR Yamatoji Line from JR Nara Station to JR Koriyama Station (10 minutes).\n## Where Can You Hike Through History Near Nara?\nPeople looking to experience the more natural side of Nara should head to Kuragari-toge which combines a satisfying hike with deep history. This can be combined with a cultural experience at the nearby Hozanji Temple.\nAccess: Take the Kintetsu Nara Line from Kintetsu Nara Station to Minami-Ikoma Station (20 minutes).\nFurther afield is the Mt. Shigi area. The area's cultural attractions include Chogosonshiji Temple with its tiger-inspired architecture, and Kongosenji, famous for its hydrangeas.\nAccess: Take the JR Yamatoji Line from JR Nara Station to Oji Station (15 minutes), then transfer to a Nara Kotsu bus bound for Mt. Shigi (20 minutes).\nWhether you want to take your time with each location or see as much as possible in a day, Nara City is a great base for your adventures."}

Wakakusa full of very playful and friendly deer. The natural setting includes temples set in unspoiled woods and a lake full of turtles and carp. The temples and shrines of Nara are much older than the oft-rebuilt buildings in Kyoto, and much more unique.\n### Don't Miss\n- Interacting with the tame deer\n- The Great Buddha\n- Exploring Japan's Buddhist history through art and monuments\n## How to Get There\nAccess to central Nara is easiest from Osaka. Nara Station on JR lines is further away from the city center than Kintetsu Station.\nThe fastest way to get to Nara is the 35-minute limited rapid express from Osaka-Namba to Kintetsu Nara Station. This will cost 520 yen more than the regular express trains that take 5 minutes longer.\nKintetsu Nara can also be reached from Kyoto Station in just over 30 minutes.\nFrom Kintetsu Nara, the park is a 5-minute walk. The park can also be accessed from JR Nara Station with a 20-minute walk.\n### Great size and scale\nThe area around Nara Park is known for its incredible cultural heritage. The most famous and the first place most visitors go is the Great Buddha Hall at Todaiji.\nThis is the largest bronze statue of Buddha in the world, and weighs an estimated 300 tons. Inside what was once the largest wooden building in the world, the scale of this statue is awe-inspiring. Do not miss the less-visited temple buildings up the hill to the left of the Great Buddha.\nSimilarly impressive is the 50-meter tall pagoda at the neighboring Kofukuji. This magnificent construction makes it the second tallest five-story pagoda in Japan. The museum here is a must for lovers of Buddha statues.\nA quick walk away from the Great Buddha is Shinyakushiji, which is known for its statue of the Medicine Buddha. While a lot smaller in size than the Great Buddha, this Buddha is still very impressive, as it was laboriously carved from a single piece of wood, and the many statues that surround it are a very impressive and original sight.\n### A perfect balance\nNearby Kasuga Taisha balances perfectly the natural and cultural elements of the area. Walk to the shrine along a path through the woods, illuminated with innumerable stone lanterns during Setsubun Mantoro. At the shrine itself, the deep vermillion colored paint of the buildings perfectly complements the surrounding trees.\nDo not miss the Nara National Museum, with its unrivaled collection of Nara Period art.\nNara Park is known for its tame deer. While some caution is advised, it is possible to walk up to the deer and take a photograph with them or feed them with deer crackers on sale along the side of the road.\nFans of animals will also love Sarusawa pond. This is a great place to relax on the benches and watch turtles and carp swimming around.\nMany people take a classic photograph of Nara here, using the pond as a mirror to reflect the pagoda of Kofukuji and the beautiful trees.\n### A playground for avid photographers\nThe great park and the photogenic structures make central Nara a popular location for photographers.\nAnother popular photograph is a shot of the park from the Wakakusa mountain itself. The climb up the mountain offers a unique view of some of Nara's most famous sights. In the evening, in addition to being full of deer and birds, the mountain offers visitors a magnificent panoramic perspective of the Nara area.\nSet aside a few hours to view the park, feed the deer, and observe its cultural highlights at leisure."}

The mountain religion known as Shugendo started and flourished here, with Mt. Omine as a major center of ascetic practices. Tenkawa Daibenzaiten Shrine is another focus of worship, honoring the goddess of water in a village dominated by its small river.\nThe Tenkawa area is prime trekking territory as well. Relax in a healing hot spring in a secluded mountain setting after a long hike, and stay the night at one of the many inns in the area.\n### Don't Miss\n- The annual Noh performance at Tenkawa Daibenzaiten Shrine\n- Exploring the area around Mt. Omine\n- Sliding into the rumbling waters of Dorogawa Onsen\n## How to Get There\nYou can get to Tenkawa by car or bus from Nara Station.\nTenkawa is about a one-hour bus ride into Yoshinoyama in the center of Nara, at the foot of Mt. Omine.\nMt. Omine\n### The river of heaven, and a sacred power spot\nThe name of both the village and the river, Tenkawa, literally translates as \"river of heaven.\" The river runs right through the village, and there is a shrine here to Benzaiten, the goddess of water. Tenkawa Daibenzaiten Shrine, built in the 7th century is one of Japan's three largest shrines to the goddess and considered a major power spot by New Age enthusiasts.\nDespite its secluded location, the shrine regularly draws the rich and famous, which creates a buzz all its own. Since Benzaiten is also often worshipped as a goddess of the performing arts, the shrine holds a lavish annual Noh festival.\n### Mountains and spirits\nA center of the ancient Japanese mountain religion known as Shugendo, Tenkawa has long been home to ascetic religious practices. If you want to challenge yourself physically and spiritually, you can follow in the steps of the ascetics and climb Mt. Omine starting from Ryusen-ji Temple. One big caveat: this practice is strictly limited to men. Large stone markers warn that women are traditionally not allowed on the mountain.\nFortunately, nearby Dorogawa Onsen is a perfect alternative to engaging in an exhausting climb. Translating to \"rumbling water,\" these waters are a great way to relax your sore muscles after a long day of exploring the area.\n### Start trekking in Tenkawa\nTenkawa is a good jump off point for hiking, and ancient pilgrimage routes fan out from the settlement.

Yoshino, a UNESCO World Heritage site whose extraordinary beauty is worthy of the many poems written about it throughout the centuries.\n### Don't Miss\n- See the extraordinary display of about 30,000 cherry trees burst into color from late March through April\n- Walk in the footsteps of ancient mountain ascetics\n- Luxuriate in the area's mineral-rich hot springs\n## How to Get There\nAlthough it is in Nara Prefecture, access to the Yoshino area is easiest from Kyoto Station. Alternatively, you can get to the Yoshino area from Osaka.\nFrom Kyoto: At Kyoto Station, take the Kintetsu Line, which reaches Yoshino Station in about 1 hour 45 minutes.\nFrom Osaka: From Abenohashi Station in Osaka, it takes 1 hour 25 minutes on the Kintetsu Minami Osaka Line to Yoshino Station.\n## Why Visit Yoshino? A Sacred Mountain Steeped in History and Nature\nMuch of Yoshino in Nara Prefecture is a sprawling national park, encompassing the sacred Kii mountain range, now a UNESCO World Heritage site. Its heart is Mt. Yoshino, which has long been a symbol of spring in Japan. The mountain is featured heavily in classical literature, poetry and song.\n### Spring in Yoshino: Explore One of Japan's Most Famous Cherry Blossom Mountains\nYoshino's 30,000 cherry blossoms are a true sight to behold\nIn spring, Yoshino's ancient shrines and temples – many over 1,000 years old – are framed by the breathtaking bloom of about 30,000 iconic cherry trees. Notably, Yoshimizu-jinja Shrine offers prime views and is famed as the site where 16th-century warlord Toyotomi Hideyoshi once held a hanami (flower viewing) party perfectly timed to admire the blossoms.\n### Summer in Yoshino: Beat the Heat with Shady Mountain Paths and Historic Shrines\nThe summer greenery in Yoshino is fresh and vibrant, making it perfect for forest bathing and relaxing amidst nature\nIn summer, Yoshino's lush greenery surrounds historic sites like Nyoirinji Temple, which holds the mausoleum of Emperor Godaigo (1288-1339) – a pivotal figure in Japan's samurai era. Said to be the last emperor to wield real political power before the Meiji Restoration, Godaigo's dramatic story adds depth to your visit. The area also offers numerous hiking trails that weave through verdant forests and past ancient temples, making summer the perfect season to combine history with outdoor adventure.\n### Fall in Yoshino: Capture the Best Autumn Views\nFall in Yoshino offers yet more amazing photo opportunities\nAs autumn paints Yoshino in vibrant reds and golds, the legacy of Emperor Godaigo comes alive. Fleeing conflict, he established the Southern Court here to rival the Kyoto court under the shogun's rule. Nearby, Yoshino Jingu Shrine – dedicated to Godaigo – offers an impressive backdrop of fall foliage, making it a perfect spot to reflect on history amid nature's seasonal beauty.\nIn winter snowfall blankets the mountains behind Nyoirin-ji Temple\n### Winter in Yoshino: Embrace the Quiet Season and Festive Setsubun\nThe quietest out of all the seasons, winter provides a welcome reprise from the crowds, and a rare chance to see the famous hilly landscapes carpeted in snow. In early February, the town comes alive with the local Oni Fest, a vibrant celebration of Setsubun, the traditional Japanese holiday that marks the start of spring. Costumed “oni” ogres parade through the streets, taiko drums echo through the night, and the dramatic Oni Odori dance unfolds inside Zao Do at Kinpusen-ji Temple. Traditional rituals like a fire ceremony and bean throwing add a spiritual touch to this vibrant seasonal event.\n## Spiritual Heritage and Scenic Trail Highlights in Yoshino\nKimpusen-ji Temple is a must-visit spiritual spot in the Yoshino area\nBeyond the changing seasons, Yoshino's spiritual roots run deep. At the foot of Mt. Yoshino, the magnificent Zao-do Hall of Kimpusen-ji Temple stands as a testament to 8th-century ascetic En-no-Gyoja, the founder of Shugendo Japan's second-largest traditional wooden structure, the first being the Great Buddha Hall in Nara.\nKeep an eye out for Shugendo monks in their eye-catching robes\nShugendo practitioners undertake rigorous ascetic rituals, including fasting and purification under icy waterfalls – a tradition still visible today as pilgrims in distinctive robes blow their conch shells while trekking the sacred trails. Exploring these paths offers a unique glimpse into Japan's ancient mountain worship and spiritual heritage, complementing the natural beauty of Yoshino throughout the year.\n## When Is the Best Time to Visit Yoshino for Hiking and Hot Springs?\nYoshino makes a great day trip from other cities in the Kansai area, but you may wish to stay overnight to make the most of the hot springs here. With dozens of trails, the Yoshino area is a haven for a combination of hiking and onsen soaks. The best way to beat the crowds in the cherry blossom season is to stay overnight and then see the blossoms in the early morning before the trains arrive."}

In Shinsaibashi, and among the bright lights of the Dotonbori district, you'll find some of the best shopping and eating in Osaka. Come and experience the liveliest and most colorful area of Osaka.\n### Don't Miss\n- Dotonbori's lively night atmosphere\n- Shinsaibashi-suji Shopping Street, eight blocks of retail heaven\n- People watching in Amerikamura, where the cool kids hang out\n## How to Get There\nShinsaibashi and Dotonbori are easily accessible via train from all points in Osaka.\nFrom Osaka/Umeda Station, take the Midosuji Line to Shinsaibashi Station. Look for the exit to the Shinsaibashi-suji Shopping Street shopping arcade. If you walk the length of the arcade you will emerge at Ebisubashi bridge in Dotonbori. Alternatively, to reach Dotonbori directly continue on the Midosuji Line train to Namba Station.\n### 400 years of entertainment and counting\nShopkeepers and merchants have been plying their trade around Shinsaibashi since the 1600s when an enterprising merchant (named Shinsai) built a bridge connecting the up-and-coming Shinmachi quarter to the theater district of Dotonbori.\nWhile the traditional kabuki theaters and entertainment halls of Dotonbori are almost impossible to find anymore, there's no lack of drama and entertainment to be had in the lively streets where Osaka still comes to play. Packed with shops, bars and restaurants this is where you'll find the city at its most frenetic.\n### Shop, eat, drink, repeat\nAlmost a mile long, Shinsaibashi arcade stretches from Shinsaibaishi station to Dotonbori and is one of the busiest and oldest shopping streets in Japan. There are shops to suit every budget and tastes from high fashion to traditional crafts. Add on a limitless selection of cafes and restaurants, and you'll be lucky to emerge before nightfall.\n### At the center of it all: the Dotonbori Bridge\nThe Dotonbori district sits beside a 400-year-old canal. The bridge over the canal is a popular place to take your photo (look out for the Glico Man; the enormous runner towers over Ebisubashi Bridge and is a famous Osaka landmark).\nThe bright lights and bars of Dotonbori draw huge nighttime crowds. Exuberant neon signs plus an assortment of giant mechanical sea creatures and clowns looking down on the action add to the fun.\n### Kuidaore (eat until you drop): dining Osaka-style\nIt won't take long to work up an appetite with the multitude of eating and drinking options in your path. The alleys and streets surrounding Dotonbori are packed with izakaya, restaurants and bars. The crab restaurants here are famous. Or try Osaka-style sushi. Many of the larger establishments have English menus.\nAlong the riverside promenade you'll find stalls serving takoyaki, steaming bowls of ramen, okonomiyaki joints and an abundance of drinking spots. Pause for a drink while you watch the world passing by and enjoy the lights reflected in the water. If you feel overwhelmed by crowds, turn off the main drag into the quieter lantern-filled Hozenji Yokocho for a choice of traditional restaurants.\n### Amerikamura: street fashion and youth culture\nWest of Shinsaibashi, Amerikamura is named for its origins as a place to buy US goods after World War II and new and retro Americana abounds. This is where Osaka teens strut their stuff in a diverting fashion parade of Japanese street style.\nStop in Triangle Park (a tiny concrete seating place) to check out the latest trends before browsing the vintage clothing and record stores. There are plenty of quirky cafes to hang out in and if you stay till late, clubs and live music venues.\nMany stores don't open until after 11 a.m., so arrive later in the day when Amerikamura's habitues are awake. The place fills up at weekends when there are flea markets and buskers in the mix.\n### Orange Street\nOsaka's furniture-making district, Orange Street t and the surrounding Horie neighborhood has reinvented itself as a hub for designer clothing and trendy cafes. While it remains home to a few old-school furniture makers, the narrow streets are now lined with an eclectic mix of stylish boutiques, hip lifestyle stores and coffee shops."}

A uniquely Japanese spectacle, the Revue (think Broadway glamor and classic drama combined) and its performers have a large and loyal following.\nThe cast members, who undergo rigorous training beginning in childhood, are renowned nationally for their dedication to the troupe and performing arts, and for their legions of enamored fans. Watching the interactions between fans and players is almost as entertaining as the Revue.\nYou can book tickets for performances through Takarazuka's English website, which also describes the current production and lists the performance dates and times.\n### An array of easy hiking trails nearby\nTakarazuka is a good base from which to explore the surrounding foothills and rivers following a handful of easy hiking trails.\nPhoto of Takarazuka\n### Planning your time in the area\nIt takes less than an hour to escape the city for the peace and tranquility of the countryside.

Ascend to the top of castle keep tower to look over the expansive castle grounds and neighboring skyscrapers. Or bring a bento box and enjoy a picnic surrounded by groves of cherry and apricot trees which are amazing in bloom in the spring.\n### Don't Miss\n- Cherry blossom party time in the castle park\n- The many exhibits at the Museum of History\n## How to Get There\nFrom Osaka/Umeda Station, take the JR Osaka Loop Line to Morinomiya Station. You will arrive directly adjacent to Osaka Castle Park.\n### A bloody past concluding in a long period of peace\nThe original castle was built between 1583 to 1598 by Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who re-unified Japan in 1590 after a century of civil war. His regime was replaced in 1603 by the Tokugawa Shogunate, located in Edo (Tokyo). The last of the Toyotomi line committed suicide here at the castle when it was burnt to the ground in 1615.\nThe current castle is a reconstruction of the castle the Tokugawa built to replace Hideyoshi's castle. The castle was under the direct control of the Shogun, and the massive double moats and stone walls were a daunting obstacle for any would-be invaders. This history is still celebrated and remembered, as the fall of the castle corresponds closely with the start of the Edo Period — an altogether peaceful and prosperous time for Japan.\n### Springtime nostalgia\nThe early April cherry blossom season sees hordes of high-spirited locals spending the afternoon and evening hours drinking and partying under the pink canopy of the blossoms, with the illuminated castle adding historical depth to the scenery. Such parties are a significant part of Japanese culture, with the season and affiliated memories referenced throughout literature and film.\n### See the history firsthand at the adjacent museum\nLearn more about the castle's history and Japan's Edo period at the adjacent Museum of History. The multiple floors and abundance of exhibits provide a stimulating look into how Japan flourished during the 260-year period of peace and suddenly rocketed onto the global stage, spurred by massive development starting in the late 19th century.\n### Explore the surrounding city\nThe swath of skyscrapers visible to the north of Osaka Castle is part of a business district called Kyobashi. Take an evening journey through the streets to find a slightly seedier, grittier version of Umeda's business district. There are a number of bars and restaurants to enjoy a meal in the company of white collar employees who have loosened their ties and rolled up their sleeves after a long day of work.\n### Planning a trip\nPart of what makes Osaka so appealing is that the city is packed into a relatively small area within the JR Osaka Loop Line. Osaka Castle is easily accessible from both the north and south side of the city, meaning you can visit it for anywhere from an hour to a full day without needing to adjust your accommodations or concern yourself with the train schedules."}

Due to their proximity to Kansai International Airport, they are ideal stopping-off points before a flight or during a long layover.\n### Don't Miss\n- Daisenryo Kofun—one of the world's largest ancient mausoleums at Sakai\n- Sakai's world-renowned crafts\n- The high-octane Kishiwada Danjiri Matsuri festival\n## How to Get There\nSakai and Kishiwada lie southeast of Osaka en route to Kansai International Airport.\nBoth cities are within an hour of Osaka and easy to reach by train using the Nankai or JR Hanwa Line via Tennoji Station, or directly from the Airport.\nFor Daisenryo Kofun, take the JR Hanwa Line to Mozu Station from where the mausoleum is a five-minute walk.\n### Sakai ancient and modern\nThe city of Sakai has a rich and colorful history. A prosperous merchant town and trading port in the 16th century, it is also the birthplace of revered tea master Sen no Rikyu. Today Sakai is renowned for its craft cutlery industry (Sakai knives are much sought after by chefs) and precision bicycle manufacture, and has museums devoted to both. Its most remarkable claim to fame, however, is the site of one of the largest mausoleums on the planet.\n### Tombs to rival the pyramids\nSakai's ancient burial mounds with their distinctive keyhole design were built on a scale that rivals the pyramids. The central mound, known in Japanese as Daisen Kofun, is believed to contain the remains of the legendary fourth century Emperor Nintoku. Dating from the fifth century, the tomb covers 1.3 million square feet (room for 12 baseball fields) and is reckoned to have taken at least 15 years and 2,000 laborers to construct.\nThe mausoleum, set amidst the urban sprawl of 21st-century Sakai, is enclosed by three moats and the burial mounds are now covered in lush vegetation. The site is considered sacred and visitors may venture no further than the outer moat. To make sense of the site, it is best viewed from the observation deck on the 21st floor of Sakai City Hall. Back on the ground, you can walk around the peaceful outer moat (2.5 miles).\nTo learn more about the history and archaeology of Daisenryo Kofun, watch a short film in English provided by the Sakai City Museum in the park across the street.\n### Pedal power\nSakai is a pleasant city to tour by bike. You can rent cycles from the tourist office and routes are well signposted in English.\n### Kishiwada—serene castle and riotous festival\nIn addition to a delightful castle (less crowded than its more famous neighbor in Osaka), the annual Kishiwada Danjiri Festival is famous throughout Japan. A lively, noisy affair, it attracts 500,000 visitors during the third weekend of September.\n### Rocking and rolling\nThirty-five ornately crafted floats (danjiri) each weighing over four tons are hauled through the streets by hundreds of townspeople at breakneck speed. Hundreds more run alongside and behind while atop each float the Daiku-Gata, a wild and fearless master of ceremonies urges on his crew, performing feats of daring on the roof.\nLike the bull runners of Pamplona, rival teams race their floats with little regard for their own safety. Stand well back as the floats pass by. It takes skill and experience to navigate tight corners along the route and accidents and injuries are not unusual (no wonder the festivities begin with prayers for the safety of the runners).\nAs evening sets in, the festival continues (though at a more leisurely pace) as revelers enjoy beers and street food and the rivalries of the day are forgotten.\nFloats & Daiku-Gata on floats at the festival in Sakai-shi\n### Last minute shopping at Rinku Town\nFrom Sakai and Kishiwada, it's a short hop to Rinku Town (and one stop from the airport).

Shin-Osaka is the home of Osaka's bullet train, while Osaka Station and Umeda Station to the south are the hub for all local transportation.\n### Don't Miss\n- Getting lost in the never-ending maze of shopping centers and train stations in Umeda\n- A leisurely walk along the river in Nakanoshima\n- Eating in Tenma, Osaka's favorite place to dine\n## How to Get There\nAs the main transportation hub into Osaka, this area is easily accessible by train.\nIt's confusing for locals and tourists alike to distinguish Shin-Osaka, Osaka Station and Umeda Station. There are a handful of major stations in the north of Osaka with similar names or similar locations.\nShin-Osaka is the station where the shinkansen stops. Osaka Station is the main hub for all local commuter trains and subways. These two stations are four kilometers apart. Adding to the confusion, Umeda Station is right next door to Osaka Station and is where all the other train companies' trains stop.\nIf arriving via shinkansen, exit the shinkansen turnstile and head for the JR train bound for Osaka Station (on the Tokaido Line). Exit Osaka Station to find yourself in the city's central transportation and business hub. Every other destination and attraction in Osaka can be easily accessed via an Osaka/Umeda Station train line.\n### Osaka is the kitchen of Japan, and Tenma is the kitchen of Osaka\nEveryone loves a good meal, but Osakans take dining to a whole other level. The sheer concentration of restaurants and izakayas, which at times seem to outnumber housing and offices should be a testament to this. Tenma is the pinnacle of this obsessive dining culture.\n### Nakanoshima—the municipal center of the city\nThe center of government in Osaka, Nakanoshima is a well-designed and beautifully manicured slice of the city. This thin strip of land stretches four plus kilometers east to west. Nakanoshima is home to the city hall, a handful of museums and historically preserved buildings, and a beautiful promenade and park for walking. Come in temperate weather to enjoy a leisurely stroll stopping at the museums and various points of interest along the way.\n### Planning a trip\nWith the crowds of people flowing from one path to the next, Umeda and the surrounding northern area of the city can seem a little overwhelming but is certainly worth experiencing, particularly if you are a fan of urban spaces and efficient development.\n### The essence of urban Japan\nGiven the number of people who come through the station everyday, it's incredible that the trains manage to stay on time, the streets manage to preserve their clean appearance and pedestrians maintain a generally calm composure despite the chaos seeming to erupt from all directions."}

From Kansai International Airport, take the express train on the JR Line to Tennoji Station.\nFrom Osaka/Umeda Station, ride the Midosuji Subway line or JR Osaka Loop Line\n### Deep for a reason\nOsakans use the English-derived word \"deep\" to describe the area's ambience, referring to the less refined, grittier nature of the streets and establishments.\nThough the streets directly around Tennoji Station have recently been redeveloped around the Abeno Harukas, duck into the untouched alleyways to experience how the Japanese get \"deep.\"\n### Soar above the clouds at the top of Japan's tallest skyscraper\nAt 300 meters, Abeno Harukas offers a comprehensive view of the entire metropolitan area. Buy a ticket and ride all the way to the top to get a look at the vast city below. The building also caters to shoppers, with high-end consumer goods occupying the first 12 floors. There are restaurants, cafes, an art museum and a hotel located on the premises.\n### See what Osaka looked like 100 years ago in Shinsekai\nDeveloped in the early 1900s, Shinsekai offers a glimpse into a Japan from generations past. The country began modernizing in the 1860s, introducing western-style design and popular culture into everyday society. Melding with Japan's own sensibilities, what resulted is flashy and bold. Get a first-hand look into this cross-cultural hybridization in Shinsekai, all while drinking cold beer and eating a hefty portion of fried food.\n### Relax around Tennoji Park\nTake a break in the recently redeveloped Tennoji Park. On weekends, the lawns fill with happy young families picnicking and playing in the park, which is overshadowed by the massive Harukas Tower next door. This is the perfect place to get a sense of the surrounding geography before you depart for your next adventure.\n### Visit Shitenno-ji Temple and discover the origins of Buddhism in Japan\nAside from being the oldest official temple in Japan, Shitennoji Temple boasts a five-storyed pagoda, unique architecture, and many seasonal festivities. The temple is not just a tourist destination, but is popular with the locals, who congregate here especially during the Autumn obon holidays.\nThey also partake in the Doya Doya festival, when young men—half naked—are drenched in ice cold water. The temple's massive grounds offer refuge from the dense surrounding city.\n### Delight in Osaka's classic food and drink culture\nNotice the slender standing-only bars filled with middle-aged and elderly Japanese? These are called tachinomi (standing bars), and are a particularly common feature of the Tennoji and Shinsekai area. Drink alongside a combination of blue and white collar clientele, who gather at tachinomi for the unpretentious atmosphere and lively conversation.\nIn addition to tachinomi, head to Shinsekai to try Osaka's famous kushikatsu (deep fried skewers). Get your fill of the assorted thin cuts of meat, fish and vegetables, which are fried to a delectable crisp."}

Pei-designed gem of an art museum\n- A village dedicated to pottery and ceramics\n## How to Get There\nIf you're coming from Kyoto, take the JR Tokaido line to Kusatsu, and then the Kusatsu Line to Koka. From Tokyo, take the shinkansen heading for Shin-Osaka and transfer at Maibara and then again at Kusatsu.\nNote that there is also a Kusatsu in Gunma Prefecture, so make sure not to mix them up. Head towards the Kusatsu in Shiga Prefecture and take the 36 minute trip on the Kusatsu Line to Koka.\n### So you want to be a ninja?\nThe Koka region became famous in the 15th century for its clans of shinobi (\"sneaky\") fighters. Training in the rugged hills, they lived outside the samurai code of honor. These spies and mercenaries became more commonly known as ninja and acquired a mythical place in popular culture.\nToday, Koka retains an original ninja house where a family of ninja lived and is also home to another ninja attractionーthe Koka Ninja Village. Both spots offer a chance to learn how the ninja trained. You can even try your hand at some of the tricks of the trade.\nKoka Ninja House (left) and Koka Ninja Village (right)\n### A Shangri-La of art hidden in the hills\nThe Miho Museum was designed by Chinese-American architect I.M. Pei and bears many of his signature design elements. The museum, which is literally cut out of a mountainside, houses the private art collection of one of Japan's wealthiest women and the founder of a religious organization that emphasizes the appreciation of beauty. Pei himself called it Shangri-La, a heaven on earth among nature. Fans of Western classical art or treasures from the Middle East and the Silk Road will find the museum of particular interest.\nA view from inside the Miho Museum\n### Centuries of clay\nAny visitor to Japan will notice the extreme variety and quality of Japanese pottery and ceramics. The Shigaraki area has been recognized for centuries as one of Japan's six great pottery regions, and The Shigaraki Ceramic Cultural Park is its modern epicenter.\nPottery buffs will love its exhibits, hands-on experiences, and annual pottery sales. Those less aesthetically inclined can pick up a famous tanuki statue for good luck. The statue represents Japan's friendly raccoon dog who's always looking for someone to drink with and can often be found in the doorways of local drinking establishments.\nNobori-gama pottery kilns in Shigaraki"}

The impressive Hachiman-bori Canal provided transport, helping to make the city a powerhouse of trade. Later, Hachiman was added to the name of the town in honor of the Shinto god of war, who has a home in town at Himure Hachimangu Shrine.\n### A merchant city dripping with history\nThe wealth and generosity of the early Omi traders may be seen in the many temples and other public works housed in the town. Today, the Shin-Machi Dori area gives visitors a well-preserved taste of how the famous Omi merchants lived. The Omihachiman City Museum is a perfect example of a building from Omi's heyday, and houses exhibits on folk materials.\n### Zen temple nestled amoung mountains\nEigenji Temple is a Zen temple where water is deeply involved in the faith. The temple is located in Higashiomi City, in a mountainous region. It is a Japan Heritage Site for the water culture that developed in the area.

At the climax of the festival, all the sagicho are burned while locals dance around the fire.\n### Cruise through the history of Omihachiman\nBefore the invention of automobiles, the town's canal was a major source of transportation, making the area a bustling commercial hub. This main artery also divided the town until the mid-nineteenth century. On the north side lived samurai, and on the south, commoners. Wander along the canal and feel the influence this waterway has had on the area.\n### Explore a little deeper\nSitting right on the border of Lake Biwa, the largest lake in Japan, Omihachiman is a great place to set up base for a day or two.

The JR Limited Express Wide View Nanki trains from Nagoya will get you to Shingu in around three and half hours.\n### Hidden hall of the mountain gods\nOne of the three Kumano grand shrines, Kumano Hongu Taisha Shrine is the jewel of the Hongu area and houses the shrine's gods. Emerging from the forest paths to see the sweeping wooden roofs set amongst ancient cedar and cypress is very memorable.\nIts current location up in the mountains was a consequence of a devastating flood in 1889 that swept away many of the buildings in its original location of Oyunohara. Visit Oyunohara today and you will see a giant 33-meter-tall torii gate, the tallest in Japan.\n### Healing waters of history\nYunomine Onsen is a tiny mountain hamlet lined with rustic inns that have been pumping up mineral-rich hot water to soothe and heal the weary souls of travelers for centuries.\nThese springs are an integral part of the Kumano Kodo, as the gushing spring waters were used by pilgrims to purify their bodies before worshipping at the grand shrine. The most famous of the baths, Tsuboyu, is a designated World Heritage site that you can enjoy alone or in a small group for up to 30 minutes. The bath is richly storied and even featured in a kabuki play.\n### Dig your own onsen\nLocated along the same bus route as Yunomine and Kumano Hongu Taisha Shrine, Kawayu Onsen has been blessed with a rare gift: the river that separates the cluster of inns and steep mountain slopes forms its own long, winding hot spring as geothermal water bubbles up to the surface.\nIn the winter, the river transforms into one enormous bath where many people can crowd into the warm waters. From spring through fall, a little work with a shovel by the banks will reward you with your own private outdoor bath.\n### Following the sacred steps\nThe ancient pilgrimage route that snakes its way through the rugged terrain of the Kii mountain range is one of only two pilgrimage routes listed by UNESCO as World Heritage sites-the other being the Routes of Santiago de Compostela in Spain and France.\nFor centuries, the paths have been walked by the whole social spectrum of society: from royalty and samurai warriors to monks and lay people, each searching for spiritual enlightenment from the Kumano deities.\nThe full walk from the coast to Kumano Hongu Taisha Shrine is nearly 30 kilometers and involves an overnight stay in between, but if you're pressed for time, you can take a bus to Hosshinmon Oji and stroll the final 7-kilometer section in about two hours."}

Stroll through over 1,200 years of history in this vast, peaceful complex, with over 100 temples scattered throughout the grounds.\n### Don't Miss\n- Experience an extraordinary retreat in one of the 52 temples offering accommodation\n- Treat your body to some spiritually healthy Buddhist cuisine\n- Touring Okunoin Temple in the dark of night without the crowds\n## How to Get There\nEast of Osaka Prefecture in northern Wakayama, Koyasan is accessible by train and cable car or bus from Wakayama, Osaka, and Nara.\nTraditionally, Koyasan was the end of a long journey along the Kumano Kodo pilgrimage route, which you can still walk, and many do.\nFrom the Osaka area, you can also get there faster by train from Namba Station. Take the Nankai Koya line to Gokuraku-bashi Station (minimum 90 minutes) and a five-minute cable car up to Koyasan.\nBuses are also available for your trip around Koyasan.\n### Explore the center of Shingon Buddhism\nKongobuji Temple is the head temple of Shingon Buddhism in Japan. Take off your shoes and wander through the temple halls, adorned with graceful carved wooden cranes, elaborate flowers, and gilded sliding doors.\n### Monk-style bed and breakfast\nWhile options for temporary residence have never been greater for the modern traveler, one of the more interesting and tranquil choices is to spend a night at a temple. Temples offering lodgings are called shukubo.\nOver 50 temples in Koyasan offer the opportunity for weary travelers to recharge their spiritual batteries. It is recommended, though not mandatory, to take part in some of the monks' spiritual practices such as meditation and copying sutras.\n### Shojin ryori—high-class cuisine for body and soul\nUsing only vegetables and wild plants, shojin ryori skillfully adapts to the changing seasons to provide nourishing food for the body and soul. This vegetarian Buddhist cuisine focuses on delivering the true essence of each ingredient. Shukubo serve shojin ryori meals to overnight guests, but it is also possible to get Buddhist lunches at some of the eateries in the temple town.\n### Okunoin Temple—a journey that counts\nOne of the most important places in Koyasan is Okunoin Temple, the mausoleum of the monk Kukai, an influential and revered religious figure. In Buddhism, though, it's not the destination, but the journey that counts.\nThe cobbled pathway leading to Okunoin passes by over 200,000 mossy gravestones and memorials under a thick green canopy of ancient cedar trees. Famous historical figures, great samurai, and royalty rub shoulders with more prosaic modern heroes of business and industry.\n### Koyasan tours and experiences\nOne of the big draws of a visit to Koyasan is the range of experiences and activities on offer from meditation, sutra-copying and matcha tea experiences to private tours with a monk as your tour guide.\nIf you only have time for a single tour, reserve a spot on the Okunoin Night Tour, which departs every evening (except on the 20th of the month) from Ekoin Temple. An English-speaking monk will lead you through the cemetery by torchlight recounting anecdotes and letting you in on little-known secrets.\nApart from the other tour participants, you will have Okunoin entirely to yourself, without the daytime crowds. If lucky, you may be able to spot flying squirrels and fireflies."}

For those traveling to the area from outside Wakayama Prefecture, the JR Kisei Honten Line will conveniently take you straight from Nagoya or Shin-Osaka down to Kii-Katsuura. The journey from Nagoya takes just under four hours and features commanding views of the Wakayama coastline along the way.\n### Quick Facts\nNachi Waterfall is the tallest waterfall in Japan, at 133 meters\nThe waterfall has been revered from ancient times by the Japanese as the home of a Shinto deity\n### Daimonzaka–the stairway to heaven\nLeading from the base of the valley up to the spiritual sanctities of Kumano Nachi Taisha Shrine, Seigantoji Temple and Nachi Waterfall, this cobbled, gently sloping staircase offers around 600 meters of the Kumano Kodo Pilgrimage Route.\nSheltered under a canopy of cedar, camphor, and bamboo, you can also climb the 267 steps in a Heian-period kimono for the full pilgrim experience.\n### Kumano Nachi Taisha Shrine—a sacred stop-off\nTucked away up on the mountainside, Kumano Nachi Taisha Shrine is one of the spiritual stops on the Kumano Kodo Pilgrimage Route and is one of the three sacred shrines dotted along the ancient trail. The goddess enshrined here is Musubinokami. As this can be translated as “tie a knot,” she is known as the deity of marriage.\n### Seigantoji Temple–a beautiful Buddhist structure\nRubbing shoulders with the Shinto Kumano Nachi Taisha Shrine is the Buddhist Seigantoji Temple. The two spiritual homes housing different faiths used to be joined as one until politics forced the two religions to split in the 19th century.\nTheology aside, the striking, sharp red edges of the temple's famous pagoda stand in the foreground of the roaring Nachi Waterfall. Seigantoji Temple is a magnificent sight that you should not miss.\n### Nachi Waterfall–an ancient water god\nIf you peer up at the top of the waterfall, you can make out zigzag paper hangings, tied to a rope strung a few meters above the cascade. These are known as shide and signify the dwelling of a god.\nJapan's earliest records indicate that the waterfall has been worshipped as the abode of a Shinto deity since ancient times, and this explains the reason for Nachi Taisha and Seigantoji being built here in later times. Standing in front of such natural power will leave a lasting impression.\n### Nachi Fire Festival—purification through a festival of fire\nEvery year, mid-July sees the area lit by flame as the Nachi-no-Ogi festival is held. Beginning at Kumano Nachi Taisha Shrine, torch-bearers clad in white swing giant flaming torches to purify the ancient path leading to the waterfall. The event climaxes with twelve portable shrines set alight to a backdrop of chanting, smoke, and flame."}

Hachiman. The moat protecting the castle later flourished a relay base for water transportation of goods to Osaka, Tokyo and other parts of the country via Lake Biwa, and the Omi merchants who were active in the Edo period travelled across the country from this Hachiman-bori. Successful merchants set up vast mansions, and some of these merchant houses still remain in the town.\n### A beautiful moat, revived in modern times\nOver time, the moat fell into disuse as a transport hub, and from around the period of rapid economic growth in the 1950s, Hachiman-bori became overgrown and filled with mud. The local community worked to reclaim the moat, and as a result it has been restored to its former beauty. Efforts to clean up and preserve the beautiful moat are ongoing, and its atmosphere can be enjoyed on a Japanese boat cruise.\nMany of the white walls and storehouse residences along Hachimanb-ori have been preserved, along with townhouses and other buildings on nearby Shinmachi Dori. The area is lined with historic buildings and offers the atmosphere of an Edo period merchant district.\nIf you're into Japanese film, you may see some familiar sights along the moat. Many areas along the water have been used as a backdrop for Japanese TV shows and movies over the years because of the historic atmosphere.\n### Take a cruise through the history of the city\nOne of the best ways to really immerse yourself in the charms of Hachiman-bori is to take a cruise on a traditional boat. Several boat operators offer traditional Japanese boat cruises.

You can also walk there in approximately 30 minutes from Kintetsu Nara Station and 45 minutes from JR Nara Station.\n### Four deities enshrined\nKasuga Taisha was built in 768 on the instructions of Empress Shotoku. While it is quite common for Japanese shrines to honor one or two deities, Kasuga Taisha honors four of them, including deities from Kashima (Saga Prefecture), Katori (Chiba Prefecture) and Hiraoka (Osaka).\n### Architecture and nature in photogenic harmony\nKasuga Taisha is known for its colors and photogenic setting. The contrast between the bright vermilion paint, the white walls and the cypress wood roofs has inspired photographers for many years. The shrine was rebuilt every two decades, a practice that lasted until the Edo period ended.\nAnother popular spot in the shrine grounds is the Manyo Botanical Garden, which has over 200 kinds of plants. The wisteria flowers that bloom from late April to early May are a particular favorite of visitors.\nWisteria in full bloom at Manyo Botanical Garden\n### Lanterns everywhere, and deer on the path\nOne of the first things people notice when they enter Kasuga Taisha is its thousands of stone lanterns—over 2,000 of them, in fact. The path to the main building is flanked on both sides by these lanterns, and the main building has more than a thousand bronze lanterns as well.\nNot surprisingly, the area is known for its lantern festival, Mandoro. During this festival, held in early February and also in mid-August, the lanterns light up the shrine and surroundings.\nThe path to Kasuga Taisha passes through Nara Park, where deer roam freely. The deer are believed to be sacred messengers of the Shinto gods that inhabit the shrine and the mountainous terrain around it.\n### Kasuga's own architectural touch\nKasuga Taisha is renowned for being the finest example of the Kasuga-zukuri style of architecture, which dates back to the early 8th century and incorporates Chinese-style roofs and red, gold and vermilion decoration. A sloping roof gently extending over the front of the building also identifies structures of this style.\n### A shrine for every lucky god\nWhile the main shrine commands the most attention, it is easy to overlook the lesser shrines. Among them are 15 shrines that are part of course known as the Kasuga Wakamiya 15 Shrine Pilgrimage. Visitors stop at each to offer a prayer for protection against life's tribulations. One of the most notable shrines is Wakamiya Shrine, which hosts the Kasuga Wakamiya On-matsuri Festival every year. This event offers a great chance to see traditional Japanese performing arts.\nYou should plan to spend a few hours at Kasuga Taisha, especially if you are a keen photographer. In particular, the botanical garden, museum and the variety of buildings make for a great tour. Combine your visit here with a visit to Nara Park, Mt. Wakakusa, Todaiji Temple, and Kofukuji Temple for a full day of activities in Nara.\n## Keywords"}

Katsuragi葛城山\nGose-shi, Nara-ken\n## Peak destination for nature lovers and hikers\nMt. Katsuragi is a favorite for those seeking abundant natural beauty and fresh mountain air away from the urban centers of Kansai.\n### Don't Miss\n- The spectacular display of azaleas which blanket the mountain in late spring\n- Taking the ropeway or walking one of the many trails to the summit\n## How to Get There\nReach Mt. Katsuragi by train and bus from Osaka, Nara and Kyoto.\nThe mountain's ropeway base station, Katsuragi Tozanguchi Station, is most easily accessed by bus from Kintetsu Gose Station, across from Gose Station. Buses depart from stop three and take 15 to 20 minutes.\nFrom Kyoto, take the Kintetsu Line rapid express train to Kintetsu Gose Station via Kashiharajingu-mae and Shakudo stations. The journey takes about one hour and 35 minutes.\nFrom Osaka Abenobashi Station in Osaka, take the Kintetsu Minami Osaka Line\nto Kintetsu Gose Station via Shakudo Station before taking the bus to Katsuragi Tozanguchi Station and the mountain ropeway.\nFrom Nara Station, take the JR line to Gose Station via Takada Station. The journey is approximately one hour and 10 minutes. From here head to Kintetsu Gose Station, a five-minute walk away.\n### Immerse yourself in nature\nMt. Katsuragi is home to a well-maintained network of hiking trails through its verdant forests. The Kujira-no-taki course, which roughly follows the route of the cable car, passes some lovely waterfalls and takes approximately one hour and 15 minutes to the summit.\n### The charming town at the foot of the mountain\nIf you have another two or three hours to spare, walk from Kintetsu Gose Station via the ancient shrine of Kamoyamaguchi-jinja, ending at Takakamo Jinja Shrine, which enables you to see more of the charming town at the foot of the mountain.\n### Stay overnight for stunning views\nIn May, azaleas transform the plateau into a stunning, deep pink hue. It is incredibly crowded during this time, and so it is worth arriving here in the evening. Stay at either the camping site or lodge at the summit and get an early start the next morning.\n### A wonderful place for nature-lovers\nWhile the spring is the most popular period for local tourism, Mt. Katsuragi offers something for nature-lovers for much of the year. Flowering grasses including raspberries and violets bloom until the summer season, and the sweet fragrance of gold-banded lilies fill the air during the warmer months before the amaryllis flowers emerge in September at the foot of Mt. Katsuragi. In winter, the mountain is covered in snow.\n## Keywords"}

Come and see this national treasure at the height of its beauty.\n## How to Get There\nHimeji Castle is a 20-minute walk along Otemaedori Street or a five-minute bus ride from Himeji Station. Himeji Station is connected to Tokyo, Osaka, Hiroshima and other major cities via the Tokaido-Sanyo Shinkansen.\n### A pink and white delight\nOver 1,000 cherry trees can be found in the grounds of Himeji Castle. During spring, the white facade hovers over a sea of pink blossoms and is the perfect place to enjoy hanami (flower viewing). You can see the blossoms from the outside of the castle free of charge, or, for the full experience, pay a small ticket fee for access to the castle's inner grounds. This ticket will also allow you to explore the inside of Himeji Castle.\nWhile Himeji Castle is arguably at its best during sakura season, it is also at its most crowded. If you are not a fan of huge crowds, arrive before the lunchtime rush.\n### Catch blooms in their prime\nThe sakura season is a national phenomenon, and numerous local weather services have whole units dedicated to predicting peak blossom. Cherry trees usually blossom for around 10 to 14 days, with the peak somewhere in the middle of this period. It's useful to have some flexibility in travel plans if you hope to catch the best of the blossoms.\n## Keywords"}

Its status as one of Japan's 12 remaining original castles makes this fortress a must for anyone interested the history of Japan.\n### Don't Miss\n- More than 1,000 cherry trees in the castle's grounds that bloom each spring\n- The 400-year-old, seven-story castle keep\n- The Edo period-style Kokoen Garden that beautifully encapsulates Japan's changing seasons\n## How to Get There\nHimeji Castle is one kilometer down Otemae-dori street from the north exit of Himeji Station. The castle can be reached in a 15-to-20-minute walk or a five-minute bus ride from the station.\n### 600 years of history\nHimeji Castle dates back over 600 years. Chosen as a strategic defense point to the west of Kyoto, the first set of fortifications was built sometime in the 1400s. The present castle complex was completed in 1609 under the supervision of daimyo Lord Ikeda Terumasa and is made up of over 80 buildings connected by a series of labyrinth-like winding paths.\n### Free to enter up to a point\nOtemon Gate is the main gate into Himeji Castle, and allows access to the admission-free part of the castle—the tertiary outer bailey known as San-no-maru. This part of the castle has a wide lawn with a number of cherry trees and is popular in spring for cherry blossom picnics.\n### The main keep\nThrough the Hishi Gate is the paid portion of the castle. After buying a ticket (1,000 yen) from the ticket booth near the gate, visitors can enter the narrow lanes of the inner castle and walk up to the six-story main keep.\nIt is possible to climb the keep to the top floor. The floors get progressively smaller as you ascend and are sparsely furnished aside from a few signs explaining the most important architectural and defensive features of the castle.\nOn the top floor of the castle is a small shrine and viewpoints that allow visitors to look over Himeji Castle and outwards to the city.\nWithin the paid area of the castle, it is also possible to visit the west bailey—the Nishi-no-maru—which has great views of the main keep.\n### Cherry blossoms\nOver 1,000 cherry trees can be found in the castle's grounds. The blossoms are free to see in the outer grounds, but a fee is required if you'd like to see the inner castle grounds' blooms.\nWhile the castle is arguably at its best during sakura cherry blossom season, it is also at its most crowded. Hundreds of locals and tourists descend upon the castle for picnics and to take photos of the blossoms.\nIf you are not a fan of huge crowds and want to see the castle more peacefully, it is perhaps best avoided during peak blossom season. Tickets to enter the main keep of the castle may also be limited during this period.\n### Himeji Castle Garden\nKokoen is a Japanese garden next to Himeji Castle. It consists of nine separate walled gardens designed in various styles of the Edo period. The gardens were opened in 1992 to commemorate the centenary of Himeji City.\n### Boat rides\nOnly one of Himeji's three original moats survives intact to this day. Known as goku-bori, or the inner moat, it is possible to take a boat ride along the moat if you visit the castle on Saturdays, Sundays or public holidays. The rides cost 1,000 yen, and there are usually 10 rides per day. To access the moat, you must first go through Hishi gate.\n### Recently restored\nAfter a five-year project that started in 2010, Himeji Castle was fully reopened to the public on March 27, 2015.\n## Keywords"}

There are ski camps for children in the winter months.\n### Go cruising\nBiwako Cruise offers several cruise courses around the south end of the lake. It's a little different from the Mississippi River, but Michigan Cruise is a grand paddle steamer offering cruises with food and entertainment. The smaller, sleeker South Lake Cruise ship offers shorter courses. Both depart from Otsu Port.\n### Island-hopping\nTake a boat from Nagahama Port, Imazu Port or Hikone Port to Chikubu Island, where the goddess Benzaiten is enshrined. There are several shrines and interesting structures dating back to the late 1500s. Ferries depart from Horikiri Port.\n### Adventure valley\nWinter is also a great time to experience Lake Biwa.

The walk to the shrine will take you about five minutes.\n### Celebrating the prosperity of the city\nThe Otsu Festival, along with the Hiyoshi Taisha Sanno Festival and the Nagahama Hikiyama Festival, is one of Lake Biwa's three great events. These festivals started to celebrate the prosperity of the city.\n### Karakuri mechanized dolls\nThirteen beautifully decorated hikiyama floats are paraded around town. What's unique in Otsu is that these floats display karakuri mechanized dolls, a tradition that is said to have inspired Japan's modern love for robots. Festival participants also hand out chimaki rice cakes for good luck.\n### Tanuki, the parade leader\nBe sure to keep an eye out for tanuki, the clever \"raccoon dog\" often seen in statues outside bars and izakaya. Here, the tanuki is a centerpiece for the festivities. As the story goes, in 1596 a salt vendor joined the Otsu Matsuri parade wearing a tanuki mask. He danced every year until he couldn't dance anymore. Ever since, the parade has been led by a karakuri tanuki doll.\n## Keywords"}

Hiei Enryakuji Temple 比叡山延暦寺\n4220 Sakamoto Honmachi, Otsu-shi, Shiga-ken\n## A temple designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site with 1200 years of history and tradition\nMt. Hiei Enryakuji Temple can be found on Mt. Hiei, the general name of the sacred mountain that stands on the border running between Shiga and Kyoto. The temple was established at the hillside of the main peak Obiei that sits at an altitude of 848 meters above sea level and serves as the head temple of the Tendai-shu(Tendai sect) of Japanese Buddhism. It was eventually designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1994.\n### Don't Miss\n- View the Fumetsu-no-Hoto (immortal light of Buddhism) in the Konpon Chu-do, said to have kept burning for 1200 years by replenishing the oil daily\n- Listen to the beautiful sounds of the Suikinkutsu that sits before the Amida-do\n- Indulge in the views from the mountain overlooking Lake Biwa and the city of Kyoto\n## How to Get There\nIf travelling from Tokyo, Osaka or Nagoya, then take the Shinkansen to JR Kyoto Station. From there, take the Hieizan Drive Bus to the Enryakuji Bus Center. The ride is 70 minutes and the service does not operate from early December to late March.\nVisitors can also take a train from JR Kyoto Station to the foot of Mt. Hiei and ride the cable car or ropeway up to Enryakuji Temple.\nThe Hieizan Shuttle Bus connects the To-do, Sai-to, and the Yokawa areas. This service does not operate from early December to late March.\n### Quick Facts\nThe temple was constructed in the year 788\nMt. Hiei Enryakuji Temple is actually the collective name for more than 100 buildings within its grounds\nThe temple houses 10 national treasures and over 50 Important Cultural Properties of Japan\n### Mt. Hiei Enryakuji Temple in the magnificent mountains\nMt. Hiei Enryakuji Temple was constructed in 788 by Saicho, a man born on the shore of Lake Biwa who developed his talents as a monk at an early age. Saicho later went on to establish the Buddhist sect known as Tendai-shu, transforming the entire mountain into a large-scale training ground for monks. It eventually became known as the Root of Japanese Buddhism, as great numbers of monks were trained here, and ascetic practices are still conducted here to this day. With some 1200 years of history and tradition, Enryakuji Temple was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1994.\n### A temple split between three areas\nEnryakuji Temple in its entirety is comprised of more than 100 structures scattered throughout Mt. Hiei's 1,700 hectares. The mountain is divided into three areas; To-do, Sai-to, and the Yokawa, each with their own main temple hall.\n### To-do centered around the Konpon Chu-do\nEnryakuji Temple's central area revolves around the Konpon Chu-do in the To-do area and serves as the temple's birthplace. It has subsequently expanded since its establishment, as despite numerous fires starting with the burning of Mt. Hiei by Oda Nobunaga in 1571, each restoration of the temple has been grander in scale than the last.\nA statue of Yakushi Nyorai, commonly referred to as the Medicine Buddha, said to have been created by Saicho is enshrined within the main temple hall. It sits behind another sacred object, the Fumetsu-no-Hoto—the immortal light of Buddhism.\nA 5-minute walk from the Konpon Chu-do　is the Amida-do, a beautiful building erected in 1937 where visitors can enjoy the serene sounds of the Suikinkutsu where drops of water fall into an underground jar.\nThe Religious Summit Meeting on Mt.Hiei　is an annual event that has been held at Enryakuji Temple since 1987 to pray for world peace across religious and sectarian boundaries. To commemorate the first summit, a monument was erected on the grounds of the To-do area commissioned by the then Tendai-zasu (the head priest of the Tendai sect) and the Pope, and is inscribed with the names of all of the participating religions, from Christianity to Islam, Judaism, Hinduism and Confucianism.\n### Sai-to, 1kilometers away from To-do\nThe Sai-to area was built by Encho, the next Tendai-zasu following Saicho. Its Ninai-do hall is comprised of a corridor that connects the Jogyo-do and Hokke-do halls, where strict ascetic practices are still being conducted. Meanwhile, the Shaka-do is the main temple hall of the Sai-to area, and can be found by passing under the Ninai-do corridor and following a long flight of stone steps.\n### Yokawa, 5 kilometers from Sai-to\nYokawa was opened by the third Tendai-zasu Ennin of Enryakuji Temple. Its main temple hall, the Yokawa Chu-do, is a stage-like structure inspired by the ships Japanese envoys rode to China during the Tang Dynasty. It is surrounded by fiery red maple trees in fall, making for some breathtaking views and beautiful scenery.\n### Superb views\nThanks to its location high in the mountains between Shiga and Kyoto, taking the Hieizan Driveway's winding roads or SAKAMOTO CABLE will treat visitors with spectacular views of the autumn leaves and Lake Biwa which stretches out below. Guests can also take in the scenery while enjoying a warm cup of tea at the lounge on the first floor of the Enryakuji Kaikan, located in the To-do area of the complex. There is even opportunity to stay overnight at the Kaikan, with the rooms and public bath offering the spectacular views of the surrounding scenery.\n### Just a short walk from Enryakuji Temple\nFor visitors looking to stretch their legs, Miidera Temple and Ishiyamadera Temple are two more grand temples that can be found in Shiga not too far from Enryakuji Temple. Alternatively, Biwako Valley resort complex is also a popular travel destination where visitors can take in the great views of Lake Biwa, soak in Ogoto Onsen hot spring or peruse the collections at the MIHO MUSEUM.\n## Keywords"}

Walk one block to arrive at Hozenji Temple.\n### A flourishing center for drama and entertainment in the 1600s\nBuilt in 1637, Hozenji Temple pays homage to Fudo Myoo, one of five guardians of Buddhism. During the 1600s, Namba and the surrounding area of Dotonbori were blossoming as a center for entertainment, with dramatic performances of kabuki and bunraku taking place throughout the district. Even the temple catered to the performing arts, with traditional rakugo storytelling and stage plays performed on site.\nToday, you can pay a visit to Hozenji Temple and enjoy traditional culture by glimpsing into Osaka's past at Hozenji Yokocho.\n### Wish for good luck\nHozenji Temple is best known for its statue of Fudo Myoo, lovingly known as Mizukake Fudo by the locals.

Here, you'll encounter quaint shops and restaurants that recall the Osaka of several centuries ago. Taste teppanyaki and other local specialties. Try modanyaki, a spinoff of Osaka's famous savory pancakes known as okonomiyaki, at Yakizen.\n### An evening around Dotonbori\nHozenji Temple is centrally located and serves as a starting point to your Osaka adventures. Plan a day shopping in the nearby stores, or spend a night out visiting surrounding attractions such as the Dotonbori Bridge and Ura-Namba.\n### When to visit\nHozenji is best to visit early in the morning or in the evening. In particular, the temple comes alive in the early evening hours, when the calm glow from the traditional lanterns casts a warm shade of orange across the narrow alley and temple grounds.

Many shops were opened selling jeans and vintage clothes imported from the West Coast of America, and this is one of the explanations for the neighboorhood's name. It is also thought that the freewheeling feel of the place was perhaps seen by the typically more reserved Japanese mainstream population as being somewhat “American”.\n### Sights, shops and sounds\nAmerikamura is full of new and used record stores.

Transfer to the Eizan Dentetsu Line and get off at Kurama Station. Kuramadera is a 10-minute walk up the hill.\n### A call to Kurama\nKuramadera was founded in the eighth century, but its origins are shrouded in mystery. According to legend, a Chinese monk named Jianzhen appeared in the dreams of one of his disciples, telling him that Mt. Kurama was imbued with special powers.\nThe monk followed his orders and traveled to Kurama to build an esoteric temple that capitalized on this powerful spirituality.\n### A mystical past and present\nIt is still believed that tengu, or mountain spirits, live in the area.\nThe temple was controlled by three Buddhist sects until the postwar era, when abbot Kouun Shigaraki founded his own religion there, divorcing it from its Buddhist past. It continues to be rooted in the worship of Mt. Kurama, which is centered on the spirituality of nature and mountain worship.\n### Climb or take the cable car\nThe mountain is steep so you might want to pay the 200 yen required to ride a cable car up the hill to reach the main shrine. The more adventurous can hike the winding path up the mountain and take some time to look at the smaller shrines scattered around the area.\n### A majestic view\nOnce you reach the top, the steep slope flattens into a grand courtyard. The stately main shrine sits in the center, overlooking the mountain ranges and valley below. The view from here is incredible, especially in autumn when the trees show their brightest hues.\nPast the main shrine, an excellent hiking trail, dotted with smaller shrines, continues over the mountain to nearby Kibune.\n## Keywords"}

They are known as the “Three Shofuen Gardens.” Joko-no-niwa represents the mountains, Kyokusui-no-niwa recreates an entertainment garden for aristocrats during the Heian period, and Horai-no-niwa is a Kamakura period-style depiction of the Chinese concept of paradise. These gardens are the final work of master gardener Shigemori.\n### Around Matsunoo Taisha Shrine\nMatsunoo Taisha Shrine is a nice side trip from Arashiyama and is also a 10-minute bus ride or 20-minute walk from Saihoji Temple, famous for its beautiful moss gardens. Be sure to apply in advance for a reservation to visit Saihoji Temple if you are making it part of your plan.\n## Keywords"}

Daitokuji was subsequently restored by the famous priest, Ikkyu.\n### Tea, sub-temples and Zen\nThe temple eventually developed a relationship with the legendary tea master Sen no Rikyu, who was the teacher of warlords Oda Nobunaga and Toyotomi Hideyoshi.\nUpon Oda's death in 1582, Toyotomi had his predecessor entombed in Sokenin, one of Daitokuji's sub-temples. Other feudal lords followed suit, constructing subsidiary temples for their ancestors. Due to this wealth of support from both the political and merchant classes, Daitokuji became a treasure trove of Zen culture, namely in its gardens and architecture.\n### The main building\nFour of the 20 sub-temples are regularly open to the public, and an additional four have special openings, generally in the high tourist seasons of spring and autumn.\n### The towering sanmon gate\nThe towering sanmon gate, built in 1529, is listed as an Important Cultural Property.

Before it became a temple, the shogun's villa was the center of Higashiyama culture, from which flowered the tea ceremony, flower arrangement, poetry, and Noh theater. Today, Ginkakuji is one of the best-known temples in Kyoto.\nDespite its name—which translates as Silver Pavilion—Ginkakuji is missing something, namely silver. The shogun Ashikaga Yoshimasa originally planned to cover the building exterior in silver foil, but never did.\n### Don't Miss\n- Ginkaku, the main temple building\n- Find peace in the immaculate Zen garden\n- Other on-site architectural treasures such as the teahouses\n## How to Get There\nGinkakuji Temple is in the Northern Higashiyama section of Kyoto city. It is in the heart of old Kyoto, next to the area of the old Kyoto Imperial Palace.\nFrom Kyoto Station, take bus #5 or #17 to Ginkakuji-michi bus stop. It's a 10-minute walk from there.\n### An homage to Kinkakuji\nThis compound was originally built by the shogun Ashikaga Yoshimasa as a retirement villa in 1460 in eastern Kyoto. He added the structure now known as the Silver Pavilion in 1482, as a hall dedicated to the bodhisattva Kannon. He designed the building to look like a smaller, more humble Golden Pavilion (Kinkakuji), which his grandfather, Ashikaga Yoshimitsu, had commissioned.\n### Beautifully imperfect\nIn place of gold, Ginkaku was supposed to be covered in a silver foil overlay. That was never done, and with its unfinished look, it's believed that the structure looks as it did the last time Yoshimasa saw it. This perfectly embodies the Buddhist idea of wabi-sabi.\nIn 1485, Yoshimasa became a monk and took the name Jisho (meaning \"Radiant Mercy\"), hence the temple's official name of Jishoji. After Yoshimasa's death in 1490, it was turned into a temple upon his request.\n### Influential architecture\nThe Togudo, built in 1468, and to the left of the Silver Pavilion as you enter, is the second most important building of the compound. It is also a Buddhist hall but built in the style of a residence. The Togudo was a radical piece of architecture and influenced elite military architecture for generations afterward.\nIt also influenced the style of modern Japanese houses. Notable features unique at the time include a built-in desk (shoin), staggered shelving, a tokonoma (recessed display space), and painted sliding screens. All of these features are still typically found in traditional Japanese homes. It is said that this is the first example of a 4.5 tatami mat tea room, which became the fundamental size for a tea ceremony.\n### A desire for peace\nYoshimasa's time as shogun was marked by strife and war, particularly the Onin War of 1467-77. He wasn't a capable ruler and wanted to relax in retirement. He was a great patron of the arts and brought painters and poets into his home.\n### Culture that spread throughout the nation\nGinkakuji was the center of Higashiyama culture, which influenced nobles and commoners alike. Many of the arts that are universally known as typically Japanese were developed during this time, including the tea ceremony, garden design, poetry, Noh theater, ikebana (flower arrangement) and Japanese architecture.\n### The grounds of Ginkakuji\nThe sand garden of Ginkakuji is famous for its meticulously arranged sand sculpture, said to represent Mt. Fuji.\nThis classic Japanese temple is one of the most popular places to visit in Kyoto, so it's best seen in the off-season or just after opening and just before closing. A trail behind the garden offers an escape from the crowds, leading up a hill to a great view of the temple and the surrounding city.\nWhile a visit to Ginkakuji can be completed in an hour, the surrounding area is a destination in itself filled with famous sites. These include many temples and shrines, including Chion-in Temple, Nanzenji Temple, and Heian Jingu Shrine. It is also very close to the Philosopher's Path, a path that meanders along a stream, with trees and shrubs that inspire contemplation.\nThe Kyoto Zoo, Kyoto Municipal Museum of Art, National Museum of Modern Art, and other facilities dedicated to the art and culture of Kyoto and Japan also make this district a great place to visit.\n## Keywords"}

Legend has it that a head monk was performing a ritual for the statue when it turned to face him and spoke to him.\n### Climb to a pagoda with a view\nTaho-to Pagoda is located up a steep flight of stairs above the temple complex, and offers a great view of the city below.\nOne highlight of Eikando is Hojo Pond, which is surrounded by a scenic garden. In the middle of the pond is a small island with a quaint shrine built on it.\nA leisurely visit to Eikando will take an hour or two.

November is also when Shorenin Temple holds its annual special night sound and light shows. Shorenin Temple, a 12th-century Tendai Buddhist temple known for its gardens, is also well worth a visit.\nEmperor Kammu buried a statue in Shogunzuka complete with armor, an iron bow and arrows and swords of a warrior to protect the city.\n### Flaming national treasure\nSeiryuden Temple itself enshrines Fudo Myo-o, the revered yet fearsome Buddhist deity, portrayed against a background of flames. A thousand-year-old silk painting of the god on display here has been designated a National Treasure. You can find various Fudo Myo-o souvenirs on sale, and write your special wishes on paper strips that are burned in a monthly homa (consecrated fire ritual).\n### Tranquil gardens\nBesides the observation deck and large main hall, Seiryuden offers small but charming gardens for strolling.

Both kinds are available in Nishiki Market. Meanwhile, delectable soy milk doughnuts and ice cream await those with a sweet tooth.\nOther Kyoto delicacies sold here include mackerel sushi, dashimaki tamago or sweet omelette, pickles made from Kyoto-grown vegetables, and fine green tea from the town of Uji.\nYou can find some of the best quality cooking utensils in Kyoto at a 450-year-old vendor, as well as locally-made kyo-yaki ceramics with their elegant floral designs.\nWhen you're finished shopping, you can enjoy a quick bit at noodle shops and eateries inside the market.\nAlso unlike other markets, business at Nishiki does not start in the early hours. However, it is best to visit as close to 11 a.m. as possible since it can become very crowded.\nHow long you spend in Nishiki Market depends on how much you enjoy shopping and eating. Some people spend many hours here, as there are also many other boutiques and shops in the vicinity. For those less inclined to shop 'til you drop, an hour or so should be sufficient to get a perspective on the eating and living habits of Kyotoites.\nPay a quick visit to quaint Nishiki Tenmangu Shrine, just a few meters from the eastern end of the market, the entrance to which is adorned with many lanterns. You can write a wish for the deified sage Sugawara-no-Michizane, who is enshrined here.\n## Keywords"}

Wander along Shijo Street eastwards until you reach Hanamikoji Street, which is hard to miss with the bright red teahouse on the corner. Go straight down Hanamikoji Street to Kenninji, located just beyond the theater.\n### A peaceful setting away from the bustle of downtown Kyoto\nWhile Kenninji's site dates to the 13th century, there are few remnants from this period. The original temple buildings, like much of Kyoto, were destroyed by fire.\nOne of the oldest structures here is the Yatate-mon, or Arrow Gate, which is so named because it bears the scars of the Onin War (1467-77) that burned most of Kyoto to the ground.\n### Artistic masterpieces\nKenninji Temple is filled with important works of art and design, including painting, sculpture, and a Zen garden.\nOne of the most recognizable artworks you can find here is Tawaraya Sotatsu's splendid folding screen of Fujin and Raijin, the Wind God and Thunder God.\nThough it is a replica, with the original stored away at Kyoto National Museum, it is nonetheless spectacular. The great gods here are depicted on a backdrop of gold leaf.\nDon't forget to have a good look at the ceiling when you enter the Main Hall—the mural of twin dragons on the ceiling is a much more recent work but no less impressive.\n### Discover the origins of Zen and tea drinking\nKenninji is inextricably connected to two of Japan's Zen “giants.” Its founder was the monk Eisai, who first introduced Zen Buddhism to Japan, and Dogen, who founded the Soto sect of Zen.\nBoth men undertook the long, perilous journey to China in the early 1200s, to bring Zen Buddhism to Japan.\nZen Buddhism heavily emphasises meditation or zazen. Zen evolved into much more than simply a philosophy, and came to permeate the arts including the tea ceremony, whose practitioners pursued an imperfect, rustic beauty.\nIt was quickly patronized by aristocrats and the warrior class, including the ruthless 16th-century shogun Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who commissioned the tea room that you will find on the temple grounds.\nThe tea jar procession every May alludes to the temple's strong connections to the origins of tea-drinking in Japan.\nThe story of tea is part and parcel of Kenninji's history, and in fact you will see camellia sinensis (tea) bushes scattered around the temple gardens. Eisai is said to have brought the first tea seeds from China, and these were planted at Uji, a town an hour away from central Kyoto that produces the finest green tea in the country today.\nThe type of green tea drunk by these early Zen monks was matcha, or powdered green tea, hailed today for its health properties. Tea was in fact not originally just a pleasant beverage, but was consumed for its medicinal potency and for the caffeine high that monks would occasionally need to get through their gruelling meditation sessions.\nEvery June, the head of the Urasenke School of Tea comes to pay his respects to Eisai by coming to offer a bowl tea to his statue\n### Zen Design\nThe dry landscape garden is based upon the monk Sengai's famous circle, square and triangle ink painting. It said to be a conceptualization of the universe.\nPlan to spend at least an hour at Kenninji to view the splendid artworks and experience a tranquil moment in the Zen garden.\n## Keywords"}

From there, transfer to the Keikyu Airport Line bound for Haneda Airport. Journeys from Shinagawa can take up to 30 minutes.\nBy monorail: Departing from JR Hamamatsucho Station, also on the Yamanote Line, the Tokyo Monorail provides a scenic seaside journey to Haneda Airport. Airport Express services take as little as 13 minutes.\nBy bus: A number of limousine buses service Haneda Airport from major train stations and hotels in the greater Tokyo area.\nBy taxi: Various providers offer flat-rate taxi services to and from Haneda Airport. Late-night services and expressway surcharges cost extra.\nWhen planning your journey, be aware that public transport in Tokyo doesn't run 24 hours.

Early morning bus services from the center of Tokyo and Yokohama start arriving around 4:30. For late-night arrivals, the last trains and buses into the city end just after midnight.\n### Haneda's history\nHaneda Airport opened as Tokyo Haneda Airfield in 1931. The airfield was centrally located in the country and served scheduled domestic flights and goodwill flights. In 1978 most international flights were relocated to the newly constructed Narita Airport, and Haneda became a domestic airport. However, the number of air passengers and airlines has been increasing, and Haneda has expanded to accommodate the growing demand for air travel. In 2010 the airport's international terminal, Terminal 3, was opened. There are also plans for a new train line to open that connects Tokyo Station and Haneda in around 18 minutes.\n### Airlines at Haneda\nAll Nippon Airways (ANA), Japan Airlines (JAL) and many other domestic and international airlines operate flights to and from Haneda.\n### What to do when you're not flying\nAs the busiest airport in Japan (and one of the top five busiest in the world), Haneda has everything you'd expect from a modern domestic and international airport. Free Wi-Fi, airport lounges, and a variety of dining and shopping options are all at hand.\nUnique to Haneda, Edo Alley is a shopping and dining area in Terminal 3 that recreates an Edo streetscape, giving a feel for Tokyo of yesteryear. To enhance the effect, Edo Alley is accessed by crossing a replica of Nihonbashi, the historic center point of all roads in Japan. If you're in Terminal 1, look for Haneda's own aviation shrine and pray for a safe flight.\nFor more modern Japan, visit Tokyo Pop Town, which stocks a wide array of anime, manga, and character merchandise. Or consider renting a \"Robohon\" for a robot guided tour.\n### Accommodation\nFor flights arriving or departing outside of public transport hours, or if you just want to rest up, accommodations are available in each terminal.\nTerminal 3 (the international terminal) and Terminal 2 both offer standard hotel accommodations, while Terminal 1 has the first-class-themed compact hotel First Cabin on site for a comfortable sleeping experience.\nTravelers can stay at one of the accommodation options in and around Otorii and Anamori-Inari stations on the Keikyu Airport Line, many of which offer free shuttle buses for guests.\n## Keywords"}

The train is covered by the Japan Rail Pass, but the bus is not. Be aware that buses only depart Oishida Station every 60-90 minutes.\nVisitors traveling by car are required to park at a designated parking area outside the town center. Many inns offer a shuttle service into town from the lot.\n### Get to know the onsen-kyo\nPopular among Japanese travelers, the term onsen-kyo is associated with small, quaint towns and cozy inns that offer accommodation, food and hot spring bathing. As weekend retreats, they are popular with all age groups, from young families to retirees. This cherished aspect of travel in Japan often goes unnoticed by foreign visitors, so live like a local and dive into onsen-kyo culture.\nThe area is a car-free town center with no modern buildings in sight.\nHaving checked into one of the town's many inns, visitors walk the streets without the usual concern of cars zipping past to beat the traffic light.\nIn the proud tradition of Japanese inns, Ginzan Onsen's ryokan offer up sumptuous local dishes to meet the standards of their mostly Japanese clientele.\n### Such stuff as dreams are made of\nBeautiful buildings surrounded by an unspoiled rural setting ensure that Ginzan Onsen is pleasant all year round. Long summer days are perfect for lazy strolls down idyllic streets in a yukata. In winter, the town really works its magic. The sight of the buildings blanketed in snow and illuminated by the soft glow of gaslights leaves a lasting impression.\nMany Japanese visitors come to Ginzan Onsen in search of its Taisho period ambience. Anyone familiar with Mishima Yukio's novel 'Spring Snow' will delight at how the setting blends traditional Japanese aesthetics with what was once seen as modern sophistication. The gaslights and absence of motor vehicles help maintain the atmosphere.\n### The finer points of hot spring bathing\nRotenburo are outdoor baths-usually hidden from outside view-which allow you to take in the surrounding scenery from the comfort of a hot spring. Another attractive option is arranging a kashikiri session in a private bath, whereby you and traveling companions can have a tub all to yourselves for a short time.\n### Silver everything\nUnsurprisingly for a town founded on a silver mine, Ginzan Onsen takes both its name (literally, Silver Mountain) and iconography from the element. The popular Shirogane Park boasts an impressive 22 meter tall waterfall, and you'll also find an illuminated cave which is well-lit and ideal for taking pictures.\n### Old meets new meets old\nGinzan Onsen's one notable concession to modernity is the Fujiya ryokan, a striking building designed by famed architect Kuma Kengo. With a blend of modern and traditional elements, including the incorporation of bare timber and white plaster, it stands out from its surroundings while also keeping one foot firmly in the past.\n## Keywords"}

Transfer there to the Kintetsu Kashihara Line from Yamato-Saidaiji to Kintetsu Koriyama Station.\n### A castle with astounding fortress walls\nKoriyama Castle was constructed by a local samurai as a show of martial power. The walls of this fortress are unusual. Because there was not enough stone, all kinds of different stone materials were used in its construction. This included Jizo figures and even tombstones. The main highlights of Koriyama Castle are the reconstructed buildings, including the Otemon Gate, Otemu Tower and Gokuraku Bridge. The castle retains much of its original moat and is popular for viewing blossoms during the cherry blossom season.\n### Flowers and tea\nYatadera Temple is famous for its June and July blooming hydrangeas.

Shigi in the same way that generations of monks have.\n### Lucky tigers\nAccording to legend, in the 7th century, Prince Shotoku was praying for military victory over the warrior Mononobe Moriya. As he prayed, the god of warriors, Bishamonten, appeared over his head and whispered a secret strategy that would guarantee success.\nThe prince noticed that the god's appearance was at the hour of the tiger, on the day of the tiger, in the year of the tiger.\nFollowing his victory, the prince decreed that Bishamonten would be worshiped in the area as the god of happiness and his symbol would be the tiger. The giant tiger that you encounter at the entrance to Chogosonshiji and all of the other tiger paraphernalia throughout the temple and its grounds are representative of this decree.\n## Keywords"}

The town is surrounded by mountains and sea, and offers seasonal treats such as spring cherry blossoms, summer fireworks, and winter snow. Check Kinosaki Onsen's official website “Visit Kinosaki” for more details.\n### Don't Miss\n- Visiting the seven public bathhouses\n- Strolling in a yukata\n- Making a side trip to Onsenji Temple and the nearby mountain\n## How to Get There\nKinosaki Onsen Station is the gateway to the town, connected by the San'in Main Line to Kyoto and Osaka.\nIt takes about 2.5 hours from Kyoto or Osaka to Kinosaki Onsen Station by direct express train.\n### A riverside town\nOn either side of the Otani River are numerous Japanese inns, or ryokan, most of which have their own onsen baths.\n©Toyooka City\nThe seven public baths dotted around the town are one of the unique characteristics of Kinosaki. Visitors to the area can buy a one-day pass for 1,300 yen (as of November 2021) that allows bathing in all seven. Additionally, hot bubbling foot baths can be found in numerous locations. If you are staying at one of the town's ryokan, all of the public onsen can be accessed for free from when you check in until you check out.\n©Toyooka City\n### Slip on a yukata and stroll about town\nIt is not uncommon to see visitors to the area walking around the town in yukata—the thin cotton kimono that are closely associated with Japanese onsen towns. During the colder winter months, a warm, cotton haori jacket is worn on top of the yukata to keep out the cold.\n### The town's mysterious origins\nTowards the western end of Kinosaki Onsen is Onsenji Temple, which is dedicated to the Buddhist priest who supposedly founded Kinosaki Onsen in the 8th century. Legend has it that a priest named Douchi Shonin arrived in Kinosaki in the year 717, where he saw people suffering from incurable diseases. When he prayed for help, a white-haired man appeared to him in a dream, and suggested that he could find a hot spring. The priest believed the oracle, and chanted sutras for 1,000 days, after which hot water gushed from the ground, leading to the creation of the hot spring town.\n©Toyooka City\nOnce upon a time, visitors had to pray at the temple before they were allowed to enter the baths. While this is no longer the custom, the temple is still a great place to visit and can be combined with an enjoyable stroll through the mountains at Kinosaki's western edge.\nThe main hall of the temple can either be accessed by a short walk up the mountain or by taking the ropeway, which can take you to an observation deck at the top of the mountain.\n©Toyooka City\n### The Oriental White Stork Sanctuary\nDue to loss of habitat, the Oriental stork became extinct in Japan in 1971. The last bird actually died in Kinosaki Onsen's Toyooka City. Konotori no Sato Park was built as a research institute to protect and breed the storks, which are a National Natural Monument, and to reintroduce them to the wild. At the adjacent Stork Culture Museum, visitors can learn about efforts to reintroduce the storks, and see those used for breeding up close. The park is about 10 kilometers south of Kinosaki Onsen, and can be reached via bus from Toyooka Station.\n### Winter snow\nThe area around Kinosaki Onsen is great for activities and includes the Kannabe Kogen area. Here, visitors can enjoy climbing and hiking in summer or skiing, snowboarding and snowshoeing during winter. The town of Kinosaki receives regular snowfall and is very pretty during this season, as the river area is lined with fresh snow.\n## Keywords"}

The tea fields, tea shops, and sacred sites make this town a popular day-trip destination from Kyoto.\nUji also has a river by the same name that you can walk alongside or cruise down, and there are plenty of restaurants and shops to drop into along the way. Uji Bridge is considered one of the most romantic spots in Kyoto because of its prominence in Genji's story. The town also lays claim to a historic tea shop and Shinto shrine building.\n### Don't Miss\n- Sampling locally grown green tea\n- Enjoying a stroll along the Uji River and watch the cormorant fishing after dusk\n- Ujigami, thought to be Japan's oldest extant shrine building\n- Marveling at the ancient treasures of Byodoin Temple, a World Heritage site\n## How to Get There\nUji is served by two stations on the JR and Keihan lines, respectively, and can be reached in well under an hour from Kyoto.\nFrom Kyoto Station, take the Nara Line to JR Uji Station. The journey takes about 17 minutes. From Demachiyanagi Station, the terminus of the Keihan Line in north-central Kyoto, it takes about 40 minutes to reach Keihan Uji Station.\n©Uji City\n©Uji City\n### The origins of green tea\nBuddhist monks brought green tea to Japan from China in the 7th century. It was consumed in powdered form as a digestive and as a caffeine booster during long hours of meditation. It was not until the Kamakura Period (1192-1333) that it was enjoyed as a beverage. This powdered green tea became the focal point of the tea ceremony, which exploded in popularity among the noble classes.\nEisai (1141-1215), the priest credited with bringing Zen Buddhism to Japan, wrote of the benefits of green tea and taught Uji priests how to grow it. Since Uji was one of the first places to cultivate green tea, it became synonymous with the drink, and its reputation for producing high-quality green tea is known throughout Japan.\nStroll down the restaurant-lined street of Byodoin Omotesando and you can find the distinctive umami flavors of green and roasted tea in an array of delectable ice creams and desserts, and even soba noodles.\n### Uji Tea Festival\nThe Uji Tea Festival is held at Koshoji Temple on the first Sunday of October. During the festival, priests make offerings of ceremonial bowls of tea in front of statues of the figures who helped establish Uji as a tea mecca.\n### Japan's oldest tea shop\nThe oldest tea shop in Japan is here in Uji. Tsuen has been in business since 1160 and is now run by the 24th head of the same family. The shop serves mouthwatering green tea parfaits and rice dumplings, and its prime location by the Uji River makes it an excellent rest stop.\n### Sample some premium tea, and buy some for later\nByodoin Omotesando is Uji's bustling 300-meter-long street lined with stores selling tea-related souvenirs and tasty bites. Visit the popular tea shop Taihoan, where you can participate in a traditional tea ceremony for 1,000 yen, which includes a bowl of matcha and accompanying Japanese sweet.\n### Take a class in tea or pottery\nFor a hands-on experience, take a workshop at Fukujuen Ujicha Kobo to learn about tea processing and how to grind matcha tea to the perfect consistency, with the chance to taste different brews. On the same side of the river is the Asahiyaki Pottery Center, where you can try your hand at the potter's wheel.\n### Uji's romantic riverside\nThe Uji River bisects the town. Leisurely river cruises can be booked for the day and evening cormorant fishing displays happen at night.\n©Uji City\nFirst built around 646, Uji Bridge features in several works of Japanese art and literature, most famously The Tale of Genji. This famous novel details the antics of the fictitious Prince Genji and his many lovers and offers valuable insights into the life of the noble classes during the 11th century.\n©Uji City\n### Japan's oldest Shinto shrine building\nThrough extensive analysis of its timber, scientists have found that the oldest structures of Ujigami have existed since 1060, making it the oldest original Shinto shrine building in Japan.\nYou may notice the roof of its main hall has a distinct curvature, built in the so-called nagare-zukuri style of architecture.\n### The jewel in Uji's crown\nFounded in 1052, Byodoin Temple enshrines the Amida Buddha, whose statue is covered in gold leaf. The temple's Phoenix Hall is topped with twin phoenixes symbolizing protection, and remarkably you can still see the faint remains of elaborate wall paintings on its interior walls.\nThe guided tour takes you to the hall and also the accompanying museum, which contains replicas of its wall paintings as they would have originally looked in vibrant color. The 52 bodhisattva statues wielding musical instruments are believed to be the work of master sculptor Jocho.\n©Uji City\n## Keywords"}

This area, nestled against the mountains, was a popular location for the villas of nobility during the Heian period (794-1185), and is now a popular sightseeing destination.\nRakusei is demarcated by the Katsura River, which gently winds around the old temples dotting the river's west bank.\n### Don't Miss\n- Katsurarikyu Imperial Villa, with Japan's most famous garden\n- Drinking a toast to the popular deity of sake\n- Taking a leisurely stroll along the Katsuragawa\n## How to Get There\nRakusei is accessed by the private Hankyu Railway from various locations in Kyoto. From JR Kyoto Station, you will have to transfer to the Hankyu Kyoto Main Line via the Keifuku Electric Railroad, Keihan Main Line, or Kyoto Municipal Subway.\nKatsurarikyu is a 15-minute walk from Katsura Station on the Hankyu Line. Other sites in Rakusei can be best reached from either Matsuo-Taisha or Kami-Katsura Stations on the Hankyu Arashiyama Line.\n### Quick Facts\nMost sites in Rakusei are a short walk from one another\nThis quiet section of Kyoto sees somewhat fewer tourists\nThe hills above the sites are awash with color during autumn\n### Considered by many to be Japan's best garden\nPerhaps Rakusei's best-known gem is the Katsura-rikyu Imperial Villa, celebrated by architects and gardeners around the world. Built on the western side of the Katsuragawa River in the early 17th century, it served as a villa for the Imperial Family.\nKatsura-rikyu took 35 years to complete. Its main structure is a “shoin” (study room) that consists of three buildings known as the Koshoin, Chushoin and Shingoten. The original buildings stand beside a strolling garden that includes seven tearooms. The main palace buildings are not open to the public, but the teahouses and gardens are.\nSince the Imperial Household Agency maintains the villa, you will need permission to visit it. You need to register online at least three days in advance. Same-day applications are accepted at Katsura, but reservations are closed as soon as tours are filled.\nVisitors are guided around the villa, with the tour taking around an hour. Audio guidance in English, Chinese, French, Korean and Spanish is available free.\n### Worshipping the patron deity of sake\nThere are many shrines and temples in the Katsura area. The god of sake (rice wine) brewing, honored at the Matsuo Taisha shrine, attracts many worshippers.\nThe shrine was founded in the 8th century by the powerful Hata clan who brought the technology of sake brewing over from the Asian mainland. The shrine's most renowned feature is its garden, the final work of renowned garden designer Mirei Shigemori.\n### Ringing out the principles of Buddhism\nNearby Kegon-ji Temple is popularly known as Suzumushi-dera, for its “suzumushi” (bell crickets) that have been taught to chirp all year round. Typically, an autumn insect with a short life span, the sound of the crickets serves as a Buddhist parable teaching the visitor to live their life to the fullest. A visit to the temple includes a brief Buddhist sermon and a refreshing cup of green tea.\nThe quiet, uncrowded environment of Rakusei provides a welcome refuge for weary tourists. Plan on taking a whole morning or afternoon to walk through the area.\n## Keywords"}

There is nowhere more \"off-the-beaten-path\" than Shiretoko. It's a great place to connect with the simple pleasures of nature.\n### Don't Miss\n- Shiretoko National Park for Hokkaido nature at its best\n- Drift ice cruises in the winter\n- Delicious fresh seafood straight from the ocean\n- Watching rare birds\n## How to Get There\nThere are direct flights from Tokyo (both Haneda and Narita Airport) to Memanbetsu Airport and Kushiro Airport, and flights from Haneda Airport to Monbetsu Airport. For travel within Hokkaido, there are direct flights from Sapporo (New Chitose Airport) to Memanbetsu Airport and Nemuro Nakashibetsu Airport, the two closest to Shiretoko.\nLocal public transit is scarce, so it's best to see the area by car (or rental car). However, there is an overnight bus from Sapporo that takes you to the Shiretoko area's main bus terminals and hotels.\n### Pristine natural beauty at Shiretoko National Park\nShiretoko National Park is a UNESCO World Heritage Site set in the magnificent mountains and steep cliffs of the northern tip of the Shiretoko Peninsula.\nFrom spring to autumn, you can admire the serene five lakes known collectively as Shiretoko Goko, follow hiking trails to hidden waterfalls, or take a nature cruise from Utoro for the chance to see brown bears leading their cubs along the shore, as well as some of the many species of whales, dolphins, and seals that thrive in the nutrient-rich waters. In winter, take a cruise from Rausu to observe white-tailed sea eagles and Stellar's sea eagles. Or participate in a \"drift ice walk tour,\" where you wear a dry suit and walk on drift ice. The opportunity to dive under the ice floes is a unique winter experience in Shiretoko.\n### The tip of the iceberg\nThe Shiretoko area is much larger than just the national park and offers some wonderful surprises for the adventurous. Drive 50 kilometers south along the beautiful coast road from Rausu, and you will come to the entrance to Notsuke Peninsula, a long sandbar reaching out into the Nemuro Strait.\nTake a stroll to admire the dramatic landscape of sunken forests, grazing deer, wildfowl and native flowers. The imposing Kunashiri Island sits just a few miles across the waters.\nIn winter, you can see miles of drift ice floating south on the currents toward Nemuro and Cape Nosappu. Halfway between Notsuke and Nemuro is Lake Furenko, a mecca for birdwatchers. Roughly 300 species of wild birds are regular visitors here, so take all your camera gear to get some memorable snaps of Steller's sea eagles and Japanese red-crowned cranes.\n### Relaxing waters and mountain views\nHead inland and away from the choppy waters of the Nemuro Strait to get the best views of the glorious Shiretoko mountain range stretching out into the distance. Try Kaiyoudai Observatory in Nakashibetsu or Tawadaira Observatory in Shibecha for the best views.\nEnd your day with a hot soak and delicious dinner at secluded Yoroushi Onsen.\n### Rich and delicious fish\nIt's no wonder that so many bears, whales, dolphins, and birds thrive on and around the Shiretoko Peninsula. The waters are replenished annually by rich nutrients deposited by the drift ice, meaning you get to try some of the best local seafood in Japan.\nAs a starter, try some uni (sea urchin) and hokke (Atka mackerel) in Utoro and Rausu; follow up with some ikura (salmon roe), shrimp and scallop in Odaito; and there's always room for some Hanasaki crab from Nemuro and its famous sanma (Pacific saury).\n## Keywords"}

The temple's stage, supported by massive pillars, is one of the most famous images of Japan. But Kiyomizudera offers more than just a pretty view, with the experience of visiting beginning long before you reach the temple itself.\n### Don't Miss\n- The atmospheric approach to Kiyomizudera\n- Jishu Shrine, dedicated to the deity of matchmaking\n- Drinking from one of the streams of Otowa Waterfall for good luck\n## How to Get There\nKiyomizudera is accessible by bus from Kyoto Station.\nFrom Kyoto Station, take the number 100 or 206 buses to either Gojozaka or Kiyomizu-michi bus stop. From there, it is a 10-minute walk uphill to the temple.\n### The only way is up\nThough the hills to the temple are fairly steep, the ascent is a rewarding experience.\nTwo streets, named Ninenzaka and Sannenzaka, lead to Kiyomizudera from Gion. These streets are narrow, and almost exclusively for pedestrian use.\nThe streets are lined with shops, many of which specialize in souvenirs or snacks. Some shops feature Kiyomizu-yaki pottery and yuba, a soy-based food that is similar to tofu. Others feature specialty items, such as wooden hairpieces used when wearing kimono and even traditional Japanese fireworks.\nAlternately, from Kiyomizu-Gojo Station on the Keihan Line, you can walk up Gojozaka.\n### A bird's eye view of Kyoto\nThe main hall houses Kiyomizudera's veranda, the most famous feature of the temple. Supported by traditional wooden Japanese construction, it stands 13 meters above the ground and is built without the use of nails.\nThe veranda is usually crowded with visitors, but it's worth venturing to the furthest corner and waiting your turn for a photo with the city of Kyoto in the background.\n### Jishu Shrine\nBehind the back of the main hall lies Jishu Shrine, best known as a place to pray for luck in romance. In front of the shrine are two large stones set in the ground. If you can walk from one stone directly to the other with your eyes closed, it is said you will be blessed with true love.\n### Okunoin hall\nFurther up from Jishu Shrine is Okunoin Temple, another inner sanctum of the temple. This hall's veranda is smaller than that of the main hall. From this location, you can get an excellent photo of the main hall and the city of Kyoto behind it.\n### Otowa Waterfall\nSituated at the base of the temple's main hall, Otowa Waterfall splits into three cascades. Visitors use special long-handled ladles to drink from one of the streams.\nThe ladles are for public use, so be sure to pour into your hand and drink from that, not from the ladle itself. Then return it to the UV sterilizer so it's clean for the next visitor.\n### A temple for all seasons\nKiyomizudera prides itself on presenting views unique to each season. Hillsides blanketed with cherry blossoms in spring, the verdant green of summer, delicate trees in winter, and autumn colors in fall. There is no bad time to visit. The temple holds illumination events during spring and fall to showcase the scenery.\nKiyomizudera's main hall was renovated in 2020.\n## Keywords"}

In addition to JR Osaka Station, the station complex, including the six neighbouring Hankyu, Hanshin and underground stations, is used by approximately 2.3 million people every day (as of 2017). There are large department stores and entertainment areas around the station serve the hordes of commuters.\n## How to Get There\nIf traveling via Shinkansen, you will first arrive at Shin-Osaka Station. From there, take the JR Tokaido Main Line (platforms seven and eight) to Osaka Station. Or take the Osaka Metro Midosuji Line to Umeda Station. Osaka Station and Umeda Station are adjacent to one another.\n### The city's newest area\nUnlike the southern neighborhoods like Shinsaibashi, Namba, and Tennoji, the areas around Osaka and Umeda Stations wasn't developed until the late 19th century.\nAlthough not centuries old, Umeda now functions as the city's “downtown,” with its high-rise buildings, large corporations and large numbers of white-collar workers.\n### Gaze out over the station and beyond\nJR Osaka Station is a massive multi-story complex full of multiple shopping centers, eateries, and more. Ride the elevators all the way to the top to arrive at Toki no Hiroba, a large square looking directly down on the dozen platforms and train lines that make up the station. Grab a coffee and relax for a moment before heading to one of the nearby department stores or attractions.\n### Shopping heaven\nJapan is a shopper's paradise, and Osaka is no exception. Osaka and Umeda Stations boast a pristine lineup of new department stores catering to high-end retail.\nTake the Hankyu Umeda flagship store for example. Start on the basement, where shoppers browse through ornately displayed collections of macaroons, chocolates, cakes, and cookies. Work your way up to the other levels, and you'll find floors of makeup and cosmetics, jewelry, designer clothes and handbags, and more.\nIf you're feeling overwhelmed, take a break on the 9th floor Shukusai Plaza in the Hankyu Umeda main store, a wide-open plaza with ample seating that also hosts exhibitions and events.\n### Find electronics at Yodobashi Camera\nBright fluorescent lights beam down from every corner of the ceiling, illuminating the shiny glass cases below, which contain rows and rows of the newest electronic gadgets and accessories.\nIt's unlikely you'll find such an immaculate arrangement of products anywhere outside of Japan, and Yodobashi Camera goes to great lengths to provide virtually every possible product you could need, whether its a new memory card for your camera, high-end audio components, or a smart refrigerator.\n### Dining deep\nThere are an endless number of dining options in Umeda, both above and below ground. Explore department store basements and the labyrinth of underground paths that stem from the stations for quick, easy and relatively affordable food.\nThe first and second basement floors of the Osaka Station Dai-San Building, 200-meters south of the JR station, are filled with authentic and affordable restaurants and izakayas that cater to the businesspeople working nearby.\n### Planning Your Trip\nUmeda is a great area to stay if you're a fan of skyscrapers, the hustle and bustle, and also intend on traveling to nearby cities such as Kyoto and Kobe. Most of the five-star hotels in Osaka are located here, and, of course, there are more moderately priced accommodations as well.\n## Keywords"}

There are few detailed rules for the competition, but as soon as the portable shrines are set properly on the men's shoulders and everyone is ready, they are knocked against one another.\nThe moment a portable shrine is hoisted on top of another, the contest is over. Each team is divided into three groups, based on age. Men over 35 wear white headbands, those between 26 and 35 wear yellow headbands, and the youngest members of the team, those below 25, all wear red headbands and wield bamboo poles that are used in the fighting.\n## Keywords"}

The city's working masses congregate at Imamiya Ebisu-jinja Shrine, giving offerings and prayers to Ebisu, the god of commerce, all with the hope of being rewarded with monetary wealth and fortune in the new year.\n### The traditional tastes of Osaka\nThe streets surrounding the shrine are packed with yatai stands, offering the likes of takoyaki, yakisoba, grilled pork skewers and more. Enjoy the hearty and delicious street food before heading further into the shrine.\n### Browse the huge selection of good-luck charms\nAs you approach the shrine, you'll encounter large stalls stocked with charms and offerings for Ebisu.

Over 3,000 people apply each year, making the acceptance rate more difficult than most of Japan's elite colleges and institutions.\nDuring the festivities, these women line the perimeter of the shrine, distributing charms and maintaining their composure despite the surrounding chaos. You'll be able to distinguish them by their traditional eboshi hats, which look like giant stockings turned upside down.\n### Planning your trip\nGiven the large crowds that congregate around the shrine every year, budget two to three hours minimum for your journey.

It's a 6-minute walk from there.\nIf taking Sakaisuji Subway Line, get off at Ebisucho Station. It's a 3-minute walk from there.\n### Quick Facts\nTsutenkaku Tower was erected in 1912\nTsutenkaku Tower is 103 meters tall\nJanjan Yokocho Alley in a 130 meters long street with around 50 stores and restaurants\n### Tsutenkaku Tower, a cultural symbol loved by locals and visitors\nTennoji Park and the amusement park were built on the site of the 1903 Osaka National Industrial Exhibition, leading to the development of this retro downtown “shitamachi” neighborhood, Shinsekai, with a nostalgic ambiance. After the original Tsutenkaku Tower built in 1912 was severely damaged in a fire, the present-day Tsutenkaku was erected in 1956.\nOn the fifth floor is an observatory deck where the panoramic view of Osaka can be enjoyed from indoors. The gold-colored statue of Billiken, a god which supposedly brings good luck if you stroke the soles of his feet—is also on this floor. One floor above, the roof top is called the Tembo Paradise, standing 94.5 meters above ground. Here, the all-encompassing scenery of Osaka can be viewed while feeling the wind on your face. Also highly recommended is the “TOWER SLIDER”—a short but exhilarating 10-second slide—going all the way down from the third floor to the basement.\n### Visit the photogenic Shinsekai\nThis area came to be known as Shinsekai (New World) in years following the opening of the original Tsutenkaku Tower and Japan's amusement park, Luna Park in 1912. It is distinguished by Janjan Yokocho Alley shopping street and large retro signboards. Indulge in the culinary delights of the famous Kushikatsu—deep fried bite-sized meat or vegetables and Dote-yaki— slow-simmered beef, stewed in miso and other seasonings.\nBesides enjoying the vast selection of tasty restaurants and eateries, one can also slip back in time at the Kasuga Gorakujo, the retro game center in operation since around 1959, and the bygone era style Shinsekai Hihokan, Japan's biggest shooting gallery. Asahi Theater, popular for sitcoms and comedian performances, and Dorakutei known for comedy talk shows, are also located here.\n©Osaka Convention & Tourism Bureau\n©Osaka Convention & Tourism Bureau\n### The various sides of Osaka\nOsaka Castle and the Osaka City Central Public Hall are also worth a visit as they showcase a completely different side of the city.\nOsaka Castle is one of the famous and historic castles in Japan. The extensive forest area surrounding this imposing castle provides citizens and visitors a peaceful haven in the middle of the bustling city. Osaka Castle was damaged multiple times by fires caused by a siege, a lighting and air raids during World War II. Osaka's government began the final renovations in 1995 and the present magnificent castle was reconstructed two years later.\nOsaka City Central Public Hall is located in Nakanoshima—the narrow island in the river running through the center of Osaka, housing several historical architectures retaining the Meiji and Taisho era (1868-1926) styles. Surrounded by an expansive rose garden and both the Tosabori and Dojima Rivers, this graceful building is used for a mix of cultural, artistic, and social activities and is one of the treasured attractions of Osaka.\n## Keywords"}

Most of these are original buildings from the Edo period, which lasted from 1603 to 1867.\nThis area is so authentic that it is often used as a set for period dramas. The powerlines that mark Japan's urban streets have been buried in much of this area, adding to the old-world feeling.\n### Don't Miss\n- The Former Kometani Residence, an old hardware and fertilizer store\n- Imai Machiya Center, a traditional townhouse\n- Kawai Residence, still functioning as a working brewery\n- Murasakinagaya, a townhouse converted into shops\n## How to Get There\nImaicho is easily accessible from Nara City by train.\nFrom Kintetsu Nara Station, take the train to Yamato-Saidaiji Station and transfer to the train bound for Kashihara-jingu-mae. Get off at Kintetsu Yagi-Nishiguchi Station. Imaicho is located just a five-minute walk away. The whole trip takes around 30 minutes.\n### Early origins\nThis area was actually founded long before the Edo era. During the 1500s it was a temple town.\nAt that time there were often violent disputes between temple leaders, so it was fortified by a moat with many gates. Only one of the moats still remains today. During the Edo period it was built up again by rich merchants, who designed and lived in many of the buildings still seen today.\n### Your first stop and shopping\nImaicho Information Center, also called Hanairaka, functions as a visitor center and museum. It is located at the south end of the main road in the area. Here you can pick up maps and information. You can also look at books, videos, and displays to better understand the history of the area. This is an excellent place to start your exploration of the town.\nThere are many shops and businesses still housed in these wooden buildings. Stop in and buy some sake or soy sauce from traditional breweries and take home a taste of Japan. Local cafes — whether in traditional or modern buildings — are a great place to take a break and look out at the streets and soak up the atmosphere.\n### Get a glimpse of life in an earlier age\nSome of the houses are private homes, but others are open to the public. Each house that opens to the public has its own hours of operation and fees, ranging from free to several hundred yen. Check for details at Hanairaka.\n### Houses of interest\nThe oldest house here is that of the Imanishi family. It was built around 1650, with white plaster walls that make it resemble a small castle. The next oldest house belonged to a family of successful brewers, the Uedas. Both of these houses require advance reservation for entry.\nAnother house of note is the Toyoda family house, which belonged to a family that ran a lumber business. This explains the symbol on their outer wall, which says “tree” in Japanese. This house was built in 1662.\n### Special and seasonal events\nOn the third Sunday in May, a parade called the Tea Procession is held. Participants dress in traditional costume and parade through the streets. A flea market is held on the same day.\nAn illumination event is held in August with paper and floating lanterns to create a romantic, old-world atmosphere.\nA couple of hours is recommended to wander around Imaicho and take photos of the old world architecture. But if you plan to relax and enjoy a coffee break at a cafe, you might need longer.\n## Keywords"}

Come from March 1 to 14 and witness this powerful Buddhist memorial service.\n### Don't Miss\n- The chance to witness one of the oldest Buddhist rituals in Japan\n- Seeing the brilliant flaming torches every night\n## How to Get There\nShuni-e takes place at Todaiji Temple in Nara Park, which can be reached on foot from JR Nara and Kintetsu Nara Station.\nKintetsu Nara Station is the closest station to Nara Park, a short 5-minute walk from the exit. Alternatively, JR Nara Station is around a 20-minute walk from the park.\n### Sacred water\nAccording to legend, the water used in the Mizutori has divine properties, and it is said the water is able to cure any ailment. As a result, visitors are offered a chance to drink some of the water after it is offered to the Buddhist deities. From Feb. 20 to Feb. 28, monks prepare for the Shuni-e. They are generally forbidden from speaking from the 26 to the 28.\n### Preserving the water\nThere are five pots that hold divine water, one of which has been used for 1,200 years. It can only be received by a single monk participating in the memorial service.\nFollowing the completion of the festival, it's said that spring has officially arrived and the cherry blossoms will start to bloom.\n### The Otaimatsu Festival\nEvery evening during the Shuni-e period, you can witness the fiery Otaimatsu Festival. Torches are used to light the way for monks to go to the temple, carried by \"doji.\" The constant movement and whipping around causes sparks to scatter upon the crowd below. These sparks are said to grant protection from evil spirits.\n### A two week memorial\nShuni-e is actually the highlight of 14 days of praying. During this time monks repent on behalf of the people for their sins, and offer up prayers for world peace and a good harvest.\n\\*Please note that the photos used on this page were taken via long exposure.\n## Keywords"}

As the festival has taken place for over 800 years, many famous people have donated lanterns over the years. Some of them even bear the names of famous samurai from the Warring States period (1467–1603).\n### The festival of wishes\nIf you have a dream that you are dying to have come true, then you are in luck, as the festival is associated with the making and granting of wishes.

You can buy dried beans and charms at the shrine.\n### Don't be scared of the dark\nSome of the paths to the shrine can be dark in spots with fewer lanterns.

The dance performed is called Noh, one of Japan's oldest dances. Noh theatre brings to life the stories of Japan's rich past.\n### The Noh masks\nThe performers wear masks, allowing them to get into character. These masks transform the performers into elderly people, children, and even ghosts. Although the performer's face remains hidden behind a Noh mask, the skill and artistry of Noh theatre lies in the way the actor expresses the intention of the role with deep emotion through body movements alone.\n### Enjoying the show\nThe performances are held on the third Friday and Saturday of May each year. Seating is limited, so come early if you want to grab a seat. Seats run 5,000 yen for a single day. If you can't get a seat, you'll still be able to enjoy the performance from the free standing room at the back of the venue.\n### Comic relief\nIn between the Noh performances are traditional comical performances known as kyogen. Enjoy the contrast between these two traditional arts: the ethereal, spiritual world of Noh and the lively, comic situations of Kyogen.\n## Keywords"}

Alternatively, you can take the Keifuku Arashiyama Main Line to Arashiyama Station. The bridge is a one-minute walk.\n### Where the moon crosses a bridge\nThe name Togetsu, meaning moon crossing, stems from a tale involving the Kamakura period Emperor Kameyama. During a boating party under a full moon, the emperor thought the moon looked like it was crossing the bridge.\nThe first bridge here was built in 836, while the current one was finished in 1934. Although the bridge appears to be made of wood, its columns and beams are reinforced concrete, and only the parapets are made from cypress.\nThere are a number of souvenir shops at the foot of the bridge. Rickshaws shuttle back and forth, creating an atmosphere reminiscent of a bygone era of Japan.\n### Memorable seasonal views\nArashiyama is the mountain south of the bridge. Its tree-covered slopes take on the pink hue of cherry blossoms in spring, and are blanketed by fiery red maple leaves during autumn. Under the snows of winter, the mountain looks like a scene from an ink landscape painting.\n## Keywords"}

The sweeping grasslands of the area are scattered with white limestone mounds and conical sinkholes. The Karst extends along rolling mountains and has multiple trails with expansive panoramas of the Shikoku region and the Pacific Ocean.\n### Don't Miss\n- The mossy trails and ancient trees of Keyakidaira\n- Other-worldly stargazing opportunities\n- Scenic hikes and stunning seasonal blooms\n## How to Get There\nHard to reach by public transport and therefore suited to intrepid travelers, this pristine natural hideout can be accessed by car from Kochi and Matsuyama or a combination of taxi, bus and train travel from Kochi Station.\nIf you choose to rent a car, the scenic drive from either Kochi or Matsuyama takes around two hours. The journey by public transport and taxi requires a number of changes.\nTo get there via public transport, depart from Kochi Station and arrive at Susaki Station to catch a bus towards Yusuhara. Change again at Shinden and take a taxi to Hoshifuru Village Tengu (formerly Tenguso), in the middle of the Karst. During the winter months, some areas of the Karst become inaccessible due to snow.\n### Quick Facts\nThe area is split into three parts; the Tengu Highland, Keyakidaira and Mezurudaira\nThe karst has an elevation of 1,400 meters\nThe area straddles both Ehime and Kochi prefectures\n### A place for all seasons\nThe Shikoku Karst transitions seamlessly with the seasons. Spring sees the grasses turn a vibrant hue of green. On hikes through the area in summer, you can see lilies all around. Old man of the mountain and forget-me-nots also dot the hillsides.\nRich, vibrant leaves cover the trees during fall months, whilst the grass turns a striking shade of silver. Then in the winter, you may find a dusting of the purest white snow covering the hillsides.\n### Forest bathing\nThe hiking trail in the Tengu Highlands that passes through Tengu Forest is a great way to soak up the area's incredible beauty. Look out for the Japanese cypress wood-chip paths meandering through the forest, which are surrounded by stunning white birch and red pine trees.\nThe walk takes approximately three hours and at the end of it, you are rewarded with fantastic views of the Shikoku mountains and on a clear day, the Pacific Ocean.\n### The great outdoors\nDuring summer months, camping is the perfect way to immerse yourself in the tranquil atmosphere of the Karst. The Mezurudaira area has plenty of campsites where you'll find pastoral scenes of cows lazily grazing. The Karst is so far from any major cities there is little to no light pollution, making it the perfect spot to stargaze.\n### A riot of color\nThe nearby Ogawamine area includes several notable mountains. Kasatori, Ogawamine, Mikawamine, and Ubahodo all reach heights of between 900 and 1,500 meters. In spring, the mountains are carpeted with the bold magenta rhododendron flowers. On a clear day, you can see Mt. Ishizuchi and the Sata Peninsula nearby.\n### Warm hospitality\nIn the midst of the Karst's Highlands sits the Hoshifuru Village Tengu (formerly Tenguso) and Mezuruso Cottages. Taste the flavors of the mountains, such as pheasant and wild boar served alongside the best of seasonal produce.\nHoshifuru Village Tengu has a large bath which looks over the Pacific and the Ishizuchi mountains, and is the perfect place to unwind after a long day of hiking. At Mezuruso, try amago, a red spotted masu trout from the nearby rivers of Kumakogen, cooked on an outdoor charcoal fire. Both accommodations also have campsites.\n### Starlight, waterfalls and fairytale villages\nMuch like Shirakawa-go, the thatched farmhouse village of Kumakogen Furusato Ryoko Mura could have been lifted from a fairytale. The planetarium and observatory offer unimpeded views of the twinkling night skies. Nearby, Omogo Gorge and Goraiko and Gongen waterfalls draw visitors with their clear rippling waters and dense surrounding forest.\n## Keywords"}

The festival turns the city into a huge party, especially during the two periods in mid-July when elaborately-decorated multi-ton floats are displayed and then pulled through the streets.\nIf you hope to attend this wildly popular festival, make sure to reserve your accommodation months in advance.\n### Don't Miss\n- The Yoiyama evening street parties on the three days preceding the parades\n- Family heirlooms displayed during the Byobu Matsuri\n- Watching the giant floats execute hair-raising turns\n- Soaking up the atmosphere with the locals in yukata, and snacking on street food\n## How to Get There\nThe Gion Matsuri takes place in central Kyoto and can be easily accessed by subway, bus, taxi or on foot.\nThe main celebrations of the festival are centered around Shijo, Kawaramachi, and Oike streets. It is relatively easy to find a spot to watch the parade from along the route, provided you pay attention to potential road closures.\n### Quick Facts\nGion Matsuri is held over a period of one month in July\nThe main processions take place on July 17 (Saki Matsuri Junko) and July 24 (Ato Matsuri Junko)\nThe biggest floats in the parade are known as yamaboko and weigh up to 12 tons\n### The origins of the festival\nThe Gion Matsuri began in 869 as a way to appease the gods during an epidemic. Every year, as per tradition, a local boy is chosen as a sacred messenger to the gods. From July 13 until the first parade ends on July 17, he sits on one of the many elaborate floats and his feet never touch the ground.\nA float at Gion Matsuri\n### Gion's gorgeous floats\nThere are two types of floats at the Gion Festival: yama and hoko. Hoko can be up to 25 meters tall and weigh up to 12 tons. Both yama and hoko are elaborately decorated and adorned with exquisite craftwork such as woven fabric, dyed textiles and sculptures. They are so beautiful that they are sometimes referred to as \"mobile art museums.\" There are two processions during the festival when the floats are paraded through downtown Kyoto from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. The largest of the two is on July 17 with 23 floats, and the second on July 24 with about half that number.\n### Night parties\nEach parade is preceded by three evenings of celebration known as Yoiyama. (The 14,15,16 and 21, 22, 23 of July respectively.) These three nights allow people to visit the floats, which are parked in different areas of the city. Around the floats, people can buy good luck charms called chimaki and enjoy local street food. Join the locals in their colorful cotton yukata robes and soak up the atmosphere of this traditional Kyoto festival.\n### See the private treasures of the people of Kyoto\nThe Folding Screen Festival, known as the Byobu Matsuri, is an event that takes place during the Yoiyama days of the festival. Wealthy families in the Shinmachi and Muromachi areas show off their private treasures such as screens and kimonos, displaying them in front of their houses or even welcoming people into their homes for viewing. Local merchants also proudly exhibit their art collections.\n## Keywords"}

Visitors to the Naruto Strait can watch these powerful, swirling eddies from the Onaruto Bridge, which spans the strait, or from one of the port's many sightseeing boats or viewing points.\n### Don't Miss\n- The glass-paneled Uzu-no-Michi Walkway, under the Onaruto Bridge\n- The Senjojiki Observatory, a great place to relax and hunt for souvenirs\n- Historic Ryozenji Temple, the first destination on a Buddhist pilgrimage\n- The nearby Otsuka Museum of Art, featuring full-scale reproductions of major art historical gems\n## How to Get There\nFrom either Tokushima Station or Naruto Station, catch a local bus to Naruto Park. If you are traveling by plane from outside the region, there is a bus service available from Tokushima Awaodori Airport; the airport bus will take you to Naruto in approximately 40 minutes.\nWith major bridges connecting Honshu and Shikoku via Awaji Island, Naruto is accessible from the major cities in the Kansai region by bus. The bus ride from Kobe to Naruto is about 1 hour and 20 minutes; from Osaka, about 2 hours; and from Kyoto, about 2 and a half hours.\n### Quick Facts\nThe Naruto Strait has the fastest currents in Japan\nThe best time to see the whirlpools is low tide in spring and autumn\nThe whirlpools can reach up to 20 meters in diameter\nThe whirlpools have inspired a manga character (Naruto Uzumaki) and a style of ramen (Narutomaki)\n### Fast-moving flow\nThe Naruto Strait's narrow width and underwater topography cause the tides between the Seto Inland Sea and the Kii Channel to vary by up to 1.5 meters, as water rushes through the Strait at a speed of about 13–15 kilometers per hour. The tide is generally strongest in spring and autumn when water coursing through the strait at up to 20 kilometers per hour creates whirlpools nearly 20 meters in diameter.\nSince high tide and low tide cycle about every six hours, the best time to see the Naruto Whirlpools will differ depending on the day and conditions, so check tide information, which is updated online, in advance.\n### Venture into the strait by boat\nThere are several ways to appreciate this incredible force of nature. One of the most popular is to board a sightseeing boat and set off to see the whirlpools from the deck, up close. Some boats even have glass panels in the hull below the water for a thrilling submariner's view of the whirlpools. The boats provide marvelous views of Naruto and the surrounding coastal scenery.\nThese sightseeing cruises are reasonably priced (around 2,000 yen for adults), do not require reservations, and are scheduled regularly throughout the day.\n### View the eddies from above\nAnother popular option is to view the Naruto Whirlpools from overhead. Built on the lower deck of the Onaruto Bridge, which connects Tokushima to Awaji Island, the 450-meter-long Uzu-no-Michi Walkway has sturdy glass floor panels that allow you to watch the whirlpools form and spin. Suspended 45 meters above the sea, the spectacular bird's-eye view makes it easier to spot multiple whirlpools in a single glance.\n### Up, up and away for a panoramic view\nAfter catching the view from above on the Onaruto Bridge, head over to the Senjojiki Observatory to admire the Bridge itself in full, as well as the magnificent natural scenery surrounding the Naruto Strait. Those so inclined can travel up the 68-meter escalator to the Eska Hill Naruto observation deck for a thrilling 360-degree panoramic view of the landscape.\n### Masterpieces for the ages at Japan's largest art museum\nAfter taking in the untamed natural wonder of the Naruto Strait, make the short trip over to the Otsuka Museum of Art. With the largest exhibition space in Japan, the museum houses a vast and varied collection, including over 1,000 reproductions of historical masterpieces ranging from Michelangelo's sublime Sistine Chapel to Picasso's iconoclastic Guernica. Interestingly, these reproductions have been executed on ceramic board, so that they resist the wear and fade of time.\n## Keywords"}

Construction of Osaka Castle had begun two years previously and he appointed his brother to oversee the building of this new, grand castle to control the important Kii Peninsula. The castle was occupied by one of the three most important Tokugawa sub-branches after the beginning of the Tokugawa shogunate (1603–1867). Following the Meiji Restoration in 1868, the castle keep was designated a National Treasure. Unfortunately, the keep was destroyed by fire during the Pacific War, but was rebuilt in the 1950s.\n### Tea leaves and autumn leaves\nThe extensive castle grounds are are a favourite spot for cherry blossom viewing in spring, but can also be enjoyed when visiting in autumn.

If you're seeking an escape from the crowds and a touch of adventure off the beaten tourist paths in Japan, this is a must-visit.\n### Don't Miss\n- Hiking trails with panoramic views of the landscape\n- Historic military bases covered in lush greenery\n- The charming 19th-century Tomogashima Lighthouse\n## How to Get There\nThe only access to the islands is via a 20-minute ferry ride from the port of Kada.\nThe Kada Line from Wakayama-shi Station will take you to Kada Station in around 30 minutes.

Take a picnic, go on a hike, or set up camp and enjoy the relative peace of the islands, listening to the sounds of nature and the sea.\nExplore the forest trails of the main island, Okinoshima, to find red brick buildings slowly turning a natural shade of green as the surrounding vegetation reclaims them, and catch glimpses of the glistening sea through the undergrowth until finally emerging at one of the scenic lookout points.\n### Top-secret location\nDuring World War II, the islands were commandeered by the Japanese government as a secret military base and wiped off all maps. Entry was strictly limited for years, but luckily for visitors today, anybody is free to enter and visit the abandoned military forts, which offer a scenic backdrop to the historical intrigue.\nWind your way through the twists and turns of the many underground tunnels until you suddenly emerge into the light, facing towards the open sea.

Centuries ago, pirates gained notoriety for stealing from imperial ships passing through the Inland Sea. Since any transaction involving officially stamped and sealed goods would arouse suspicion among the authorities, legend has it that the pirates cunningly hid them away somewhere on these untouched islands, so keep your eyes peeled when you visit.\n## Keywords"}

Immersion in one of Yunomine's many hot spring baths offers relief for both body and soul.\n©Tanabe City Tourism Promotion Division\n### Don't Miss\n- A private bath in Tsuboyu, the only UNESCO World Heritage-listed hot spring in the world\n- Boiling fresh eggs and vegetables in the hot spring water\n- A night in a historical inns\n## How to Get There\nBuses from Shingu Station take around one hour to reach the village. Get off at the Yunomine Onsen bus stop.\nAlternatively, take a bus from JR Kii-Tanabe Station. Yunomine Onsen is located along the same bus route that brings you to Hongu Taisha, as well as several other hot spring sites. From JR Kii-Tanabe Station, the journey takes about 2 hours.\n### Quick Facts\nThought to be the oldest onsen in Japan, its history dates back over 1,800 years\nEntry to the Tsuboyu bath is first-come first-served, and allocated in 30-minute time slots\nThe legend surrounding the miraculous healing found in Tsuboyu is recounted in kabuki plays\n©Tanabe City Tourism Promotion Division\n### The story behind the name\nAccording to legend, the village owes its wealth of medicinal waters to the Buddha of healing, Yakushi Nyorai. There is a statue of Yakushi Nyorai inside the local temple Tokoji, and keen observers will notice a hole in its chest. It is said that fountains of water came gushing from this opening and that from there the original name of the area was born: Yunomune, \"Chest of Hot Water.\"\n### Pilgrimage pit-stop\nThe hot waters of the area were a godsend for many pilgrims walking the Kumano Kodo Pilgrimage Route. It was here that they could rest and soak in the springs to revitalize both mind and body before continuing. Nearly every inn in the town offers its own hot spring baths, and there are several public baths for anyone to use.\nCompared to other expansive, scenic hot springs, you'd be forgiven for overlooking the tiny wooden cabin on the riverside that is Tsuboyu. The bath is only big enough for two at a time, but is the only UNESCO registered onsen in the world.\nTsuboyu's legend dates back centuries to when a famous military commander with an incurable disease was healed by the waters, a story now immortalized in kabuki plays and religious texts. Its mystical water is said to change color seven times a day, and bathers come from far and wide to be revitalized in its waters.\n### Bathing in the legendary location\nBathing in Tsuboyu before approaching Kumano Hongu Taisha Shrine, became an important part of the journey, as tales of its healing powers spread. It is for this connection to the Kumano Kodo pilgrimage that Tsuboyu was granted the singular distinction as a UNESCO World Heritage hot spring bath.\n### Nature's community kitchen\nThe natural hot water in this area can be used for more than just relaxing tired muscles and minds. Try onsen tamago, or hot-spring eggs, boiled in the near-boiling, mineral-rich waters at the specially designed cooking area called Yuzutsu, located down by the riverbank.\nThere is a convenient shop near the onsen where eggs and vegetables can be purchased.\n## Keywords"}

Winding through the mountains of Honshu's Kii Peninsula, an area straddling Wakayama, Nara, Osaka and Mie prefectures, it's been walked by pilgrims on their quest for enlightenment for over a millennium.\nModern travelers come to experience moments of quiet contemplation, commune with nature, and go deep into Japan's spiritual history.\n### Don't Miss\n- Treading the same paths as past pilgrims, including ascetics, samurai, emperors, and monks\n- Kumano Nachi-taisha Shrine and its temple, a perfect example of Shinto-Buddhist fusion\n- Taking advantage of the luggage shuttle services along the route so you can trek baggage free\n## How to Get There\nThe pilgrimage trails crisscross the Kii Peninsula, and access depends on your ultimate destination and how far you wish to hike. The main means of transportation to the area are Osaka, Kyoto, and Nagoya using the Kisei Mainline (also known as the Kinokuni line).\nTo access Kumano Nachi Taisha Shrine and Nachi Seigantoji Temple, take a 30-minute bus from Kii-Katsuura Station (on the JR Kinokuni Line) to the parking lot in front of the shrine and temple.\nAccess Kumano Hayatama Taisha via a 15-minute walk from JR Shingu Station, also on the JR Kinokuni Line.\nKumano Hongu Taisha is approximately an hour and 15 minutes from Kii-Tanabe Station (on the JR Kinokuni Line) via Ryujin Bus on the Kumano Hongu Line. Get off at Kumano Hongu Taisha-mae.\n### Quick Facts\nThe entire pilgrimage route is made up of seven trails\nIn 2004 the traditional trails along with their holy mountains were designated a UNESCO World Heritage site\nA mythical three-legged crow is the symbol of the Kumano Kodo, and of Japan's national soccer team\n### Kumano, the dwelling place of the gods\nSince its earliest days, the Kumano region has been regarded as a spiritually powerful area where gods inhabit the very fabric of the natural landscape.\nDuring the Heian Period (794-1185), former emperors began making the arduous trek to the region in search of spiritual enlightenment. The pilgrimage gradually became more widely known from that time.\n### The spiritual triumvirate of Kumano Sanzan\nKumano Sanzan is the collective name for the area's three most sacred shrines: Kumano Hayatama Taisha Shrine, Kumano Nachi Taisha Shrine (including adjoining Nachi Seigantoji Temple) and Kumano Hongu Taisha Shrine.\nTogether they are the sacred center of the Kumano region. Uniquely designed and originally offering separate forms of nature worship, the three eventually merged, becoming a major pilgrimage destination.\n### 99 Oji Shrines as spiritual signposts\nWhile the Kumano Sanzan shrines remain the big draw of the pilgrimage, many smaller shrines are scattered along the route. Known as the 99 Oji Shrines, their purpose is to provide protection and guidance for the wandering pilgrims.\n### Religious harmony through Shinbutsu-shugo\nBefore political policy forced them apart in the late 19th century, Buddhism and Shinto coexisted quite peacefully as Shinbutsu-shugo, a fusion of the two belief systems. Shinto gods were considered to be indigenous manifestations of Buddhist deities. This was the norm in Japan for over a thousand years.\nIn the 19th century, Buddhism was separated from Shinto and many temples and Buddhist statues were destroyed.\nWhile it's relatively rare to find Buddhist and Shinto elements intertwined today, Kumano Nachi Taisha Shrine and the adjoining Nachi Seigantoji Temple illustrate the traditional relationship very well.\n## Keywords"}
