Animators Studio Ghibli are slated to open a theme park in the prefecture in 2022.\n## How to Get There\nLocated in the middle of Honshu, Nagoya is a key transportation hub.

It also gives you a marvellous vantage point for viewing the area's spectacular cherry blossoms in spring or maple trees in autumn.\nBuilt by the uncle of Oda Nobunaga (1534–1582), the castle's old wooden steps are polished smooth from generations of footsteps.\n### The teahouse of a feudal lord\nInuyama also has one of the finest examples of a teahouse from the golden age of tea in the 16th century, Jo-an, built by Nobunaga's brother Uraku and considered a masterpiece of early Edo period architecture. The attached Urakuen Garden is an example of the artistry of the age.\nWhile you amble through the bamboo groves and down Jo-an's stone-paved paths, you can sense the stillness and serenity that the Japanese art of tea instills. And no wonder: Uraku was one of the seven leading disciples of Sen-no-Rikyu, considered an outstanding master of tea ceremony in Japan and the father of the tradition of wabi-sabi, which is based on the acceptance of transience and imperfection.\n### Enjoy the festivities\nInuyama Festival is one of Aichi's most spectacular. Its 8-meter-tall wooden floats are pulled through the town by locals and heaved around street corners. Try not to fear for the flute-playing children within as the floats seem close to toppling to the ground.\nAt night, the floats are lit up with hundreds of paper lanterns that cast a flickering glow upon the cherry trees that line the old streets.\n### A festival that celebrates life\nFor a singular cultural experience, another nearby festival that you certainly shouldn't miss is the Honen Festival. The highlight of this March 15 event is an approximately 300-kilo phallus being pulled through the streets of the small castle town of Komaki. You'll be invited to indulge in free glasses of sake as the locals pray for a good harvest in the coming year.\nThe scene for most of the festival is Tagata Jinja, which also features other examples of manmade phalluses. The large phallus is carved new every year from a cypress log.\n### Museums out in the open\nExplore revolutionary times around the world and in Japan at Inuyama's remarkable open-air museums. At the Little World Museum of Man, for example, you can visit a Korean farmhouse, an opulent Peruvian home, a Burkinabe compound and a Swedish Sami tent in a family-friendly celebration of cultures from all over the world.\nMeiji Mura, on the other hand, reflects life in the culturally tumultuous Meiji period. You can see how Western culture inspired Japanese architects as the nation moved from its samurai past into the modern era."}

From JR Nagoya Station it's around 20 minutes via the Hikari bullet train.\n### Witness one-of-a-kind, dramatic fireworks\nIn summer, visitors can experience the explosive sounds of fireworks being shot into the air in Toyohashi. The castle city is the birthplace of handheld tezutsu fireworks—the dramatic scale of the Toyohashi Gion Festival is difficult to find anywhere else.\nDuring the event, over 450-year-old tezutsu cannons send spectacular sparks into the air, which cascade down like waterfalls. You can also learn to perform the ‘bamboo grass dance,' unique to the region.\n### Sea monsters be gone\nTo ward off sea monsters, these amazingly gigantic lanterns had to be imposing. The Lantern Festival (Ochochin Matsuri) was started to keep the terrifying monsters at bay. Today you can witness how the festival, with its 6- to 10-meter-tall paper lanterns, has grown into a spellbinding demonstration of local pride and artistry.\n### Foxes as far as the eye can see\nToyokawa Inari is a Buddhist temple that has fused both Shinto and Buddhist practices. It enshrines a deity astride a white fox carrying an ear of rice along with the main deity. Walk around the vast temple grounds amid thousands of stone statues of foxes wearing red aprons.\n### An island shrine of romance\nRising out of Mikawa Bay, the entirety of the dome-shaped island of Takeshima is a sanctuary. After crossing the bridge, explore the island and discover shrines hidden among the coves.\nIn the middle of the island you will find Yaotomi Shrine. It is believed that worshiping here brings good luck in marriage and childbirth. The shrine is dedicated to Benten (or Benzaiten), the goddess of entertainment and marriage.\n### One of Aichi's best amusement parks\nAt Lagunasia, part of Laguna Ten Bosch, enjoy rides and attractions including roller coasters, boat rides, and a 65-meter-high Ferris wheel. There are also six swimming pools and a shopping complex.\n### A historic castle\nAs a post town with lodging along the historic Old Tokaido Highway from Kyoto to Edo (Tokyo), Toyohashi is steeped in history, and was depicted in many classic woodblock prints in the Edo period. One popular subject for these works was Yoshida Castle. Today you can wander the ruins of the castle or climb to the top of the reconstructed Kurogane Yagura, one of the castle's towers.\nCharming all year round, Yoshida Castle takes on an extra beauty in spring when the surrounding cherry blossoms are in bloom."}

It has extensive retail shops and great restaurants where you can sample many of the delights of the city without ever leaving the station.\nNagoya is famed for its full-flavored, piquant cuisine, and throughout the station area you can find fantastic restaurants dishing up peppery chicken wings, succulent red miso pork cutlets, and spicy \"Taiwan\" ramen.\n### Taste the culture and then the food\nThe great warlords Oda Nobunaga, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, and Tokugawa Ieyasu, the three most famous samurai in Japanese history, all have origins in Nagoya and played a part in reunifying Japan after a century of civil war.\nHideyoshi was born in what is now Nagoya, as was Nobunaga, who made Nagoya Castle his home. Ieyasu was born in Okazaki Castle in Aichi prefecture (Nagoya's prefecture), and the legacy of the most important sub-branch of the Tokugawa Clan lives on in the Tokugawa Art Museum, which continues to be managed by the family foundation.\nThough the castle at Kiyosu is the oldest in the area, it is the towering Nagoya Castle that is the symbol of the city. Walking its grounds while chatting with \"samurai warlords\" dressed in full armor will give you a taste of the historical importance of the city.\n©Nagoya Convention & Visitors Bureau\n### Dancing and sumo, clothing optional\nNo matter what time of year you are in central Nagoya, you are bound to come across a major spectacle, event or festival.

Within 15 minutes of the station you can see the galaxy and beyond in the world's largest planetarium at the City Science Museum, learn about the history of Aichi's most famous company at the Toyota Commemorative Museum of Industry and Technology, or discover samurai culture at the Tokugawa Art Museum.\n©Nagoya Convention & Visitors Bureau\n©Nagoya Convention & Visitors Bureau\n### A city in bloom\nDespite it being a thriving city center, in late March everyone stops what they are doing to enjoy the glorious cherry blossoms. To join the lively party, head over to Tsuruma Park, the Nagoya Castle grounds or nearby Meijo Park.\n### Shop until the lights stop shining\nWhether you head to the station for its upmarket department stores, Sakae for its high street shopping, or Osu for its 400-year-old commercial arcade, there are plenty of opportunities for all your shopping needs.\n©Nagoya Convention & Visitors Bureau"}

The center of Japan's manufacturing power, it's known for industrial and historic power—celebrated in the form of great museums—as well as a grand zoo and botanical gardens, Legoland and a revered shrine that houses one of the country's three Imperial regalia. The city's proximity to Kyoto, Osaka and Tokyo make it a convenient stop.\n### Don't Miss\n- Building on your imagination at Legoland\n- One of the country's best cherry blossom spots\n- The city's great zoo and aquarium\n## How to Get There\nNagoya is one of Japan's central transit points, making it simple to get to the city from almost anywhere in the country.\nFrom Tokyo, the bullet train takes just one hour and 40 minutes, and from Kyoto it's 35 minutes.\n### One of Japan's most revered shrines, and a singular treasure\nJapan's second largest shrine, Atsuta-jingu Shrine, holds a singular treasure known as the Sword of Kusanagi, one of Japan's three Imperial regalia. As you wander around the main shrine's sprawling, sun-dappled, thousand-year-old cedar groves, you will also discover many hidden shrines within secluded copses.\nIn June, the shrine is lit by the lamps of the Kento Makiwara floats, and you can watch a variety of traditional Japanese performing arts at the Atsuta Festival. During New Year's, join the thousands of locals who flock to the shrine to pray for good fortune in the coming year.\n### Beautiful, bountiful blossoms along the riverside\nSpringtime is an excellent time to be in and around Nagoya. Plum blossoms and cherry blossoms cover the city in the white, pink and red of their blooms. For the best views, walk along the Yamazakigawa Riverside or take a stroll around the Botanical Gardens of Higashiyama Zoo.\n©Nagoya Convention & Visitors Bureau\n### One of Asia's biggest attractions, and the world's biggest outdoor pool\nIn fact, the Higashiyama Zoo and Botanical Gardens has more to offer than its cherry trees. As you amble through its extensive grounds, you'll find some of its 7,000 plant species and make friends with many of the 550 animals that call the zoo home, including a gorilla famous for its good looks. Nagoya Port Aquarium is one of Japan's biggest and best, and holds shows in the world's largest outdoor pool.\n©Nagoya City Higashiyama Zoo & Botanical Gardens\n### Building blocks of fun at Legoland\nAn even more magnetic draw for kids is Legoland Japan. Ride and play at over 40 different attractions, learn how to build amazing constructions, and wonder at how they managed to put together some 10,000 different models from 17 million Lego blocks.\n### From roads to rails, Nagoya is central to Japan\nThe city's marvelous museums celebrate Nagoya's status as Japan's main hub of industry and transport. At the Toyota Automobile Museum, you can see more than 140 beautifully maintained cars from the birth of motoring to the present day, and everything from family cars to luxury models, historic classics to modern super cars. The Toyota Corporation has more than one museum in the Nagoya area, and there are tours of the facility available.\nOff the roads and on to the rails, at the SCMaglev and Railway Park you can climb in and under a collection of 39 retired train cars, and even drive some them in simulators. From steam locomotives to the newest designs of the magnetically levitated bullet train, you'll gain an appreciation of train travel in Japan."}

One fantastic way to see the influence and prosperity that the company has brought to the area is to visit the Toyota Kaikan Museum.\nThe company is also the sponsor of the city's stadium, a venue for the 2019 Rugby World Cup and home of local soccer team Nagoya Grampus. Sports fans will not want to miss the electric atmosphere of the games at Toyota Stadium.\n### History and beauty hand in hand\nThe nearby city of Okazaki is a haven for those with an interest in samurai history, with its castle the birthplace of the great shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu. Take in the view from the top of the castle keep, meet ‘samurai warriors' within the grounds, or walk in the warlord's footsteps around the adjoining park, ranked as one of Japan's top 100 cherry blossom sites.\n### Autumnal grace and fabulous festival\nIn fall, head for Korankei Gorge in Toyota City during November's Korankei Maple Festival to see the 4,000 maple trees as they turn to a vibrant red. Possibly one of the most beautiful of autumn views in the entire Chubu region.\nLocated in the mountains east of Toyota, Yuya hot springs offers an attractive, authentic townscape nestled in the hillside. Nearby is Mt. Horaiji, an area of unspoiled natural beauty and tranquil spiritualism.\nWhether hiking to the top of the Mt. Horaiji or just half way up to Horaiji Temple, with its vistas of the valley below, listen carefully for the distinctive ‘bu-po-so' calls of the Eurasian scops owl.\n### Step back in time\nThough Toyota is the epitome of modern Japanese manufacturing, at Sanshu Asuke Yashiki near Korankei Gorge, learn how things used to be done. With a step back in time, this open-air museum demonstrates the handiworks of yesterday, including the production of paper umbrellas, bamboo handicrafts, and weaving.\nAfter watching the masters at work, put your own skills to the test by making straw sandals or weaving bamboo."}

The prefecture is served by local JR trains and highway buses as well. There are many domestic and international flights to Chubu Centrair International Airport for easy access to southern Gifu, and some domestic flights to Toyama Airport for service to the northeast.\nNagoya is the main jump-off point for Gifu Prefecture, with the JR Takayama Line providing service to Gifu City, Gero, Takayama and most of the other key places in Gifu.

Highway buses run from Tokyo and Osaka to Takayama Bus Center.\n### Don’t Miss\n- The riot of color and music during Takayama's spring and autumn festivals\n- Thatched-roof houses in Shirakawa-go and Gokayama\n- The soothing waters of Gero Onsen, considered one of Japan's best\n- The world-renowned swordsmiths of Seki and the ancient tradition of cormorant fishing on the Nagara River\n## Explore Gifu by Area\n- \\\\\nNakatsugawa ＆ Around\n- \\\\\nGifu City & Around\n- \\\\\nGujo Hachiman\n- \\\\\nOkuhida\n- \\\\\nHida Takayama\n- \\\\\nGifu Ski Resorts\n## Trending Attractions in Gifu\n- Shirakawa-go AreaShirakawa-go Area\\\\\nShirakawa-go\n- Namonaki Ike aka Monet Pond\\\\\nMonet's Pond\n- Takayama Festival\\\\\nTakayama Spring Festival\n- Magome-juku\\\\\nMagome (Nakasendo)\n- Sanno-machi Historic District\\\\\nSanmachi Historic District\n## Local Specialties\n- Hida Shunkei Lacquerware\nThe natural beauty of wood grain is preserved using the 400-year-old technique known as Shunkei lacquer. Cypress and horse chestnut are often used to create an array of utilitarian objects. Once coated in Shunkei lacquer, they become both beautiful and durable, granting them a long life that only serves to enhance their appearance.\n- Gifu Paper Lanterns\nPaper, bamboo, wood and patience: the materials needed to create the beautiful Gifu-chochin lanterns designated as a national craft for over 20 years. Hand-painted on delicate washi paper, fitted to a weightless bamboo skeleton, the decorative lanterns emit a warm and welcoming glow.\n- Ichii Wood Carving\nMade from yew, the prefectural tree of Gifu, ichii ittobori is a traditional form of carving in Hida, crafted using only chisels and left unstained. Master sculptors hew objects that delicately bring attention to this wood’s fine grain.\n- Kuri Kinton\nKuri kinton is a dish of boiled chestnuts that are greated, booked, and candied with a little sugar. After cooking, the chestnuts are squeezed one by one. The dish itself has a mild sweetness.\n- Ayu\nThe ayu or sweetfish can be found in the waters of the Nagara River in Gifu, and a traditional method of catching them is to use cormorants. In season from summer to autumn, ayu are best eaten after grilling over an open flame with just a sprinkling of salt.\n- Fuyu Persimmons\nFuyu persimmons have no core, seeds or tannins, a texture similar to a pear, and the subtle flavors of dates, brown sugar and cinnamon. You can peel and slice these vibrant orange fruits just like an apple.\n- Keichan\nThe seasoning for this dish can be miso, soy sauce, or salt-based depending on the region. It features chicken thighs stir-fried with cabbage. Often served on a bed of pan-fried noodles, keichan is a warm and comforting dish.\n- Hida Beef\nHida beef is known for its marbling and a layer of fat that retains the aroma and juices of the meat when grilled. You'll know that the meat is tender and well marbled because you can separate it using only chopsticks.\n- Seki Blades\nSeki hamono are forged blades produced in Seki. Bladesmithing there dates back to the 13th century, when craftsmen began making swords. When the end of the feudal era ushered in a new age, those craftsmen began producing kitchen knives and other cutlery instead of samurai weaponry.\n- Mino Ware\nMino yaki is porcelain made in Tono. There are fifteen different types, with the most popular styles being oribe, shino and kizeto ware. This tradition, which likely dates back to the 7th century, now produces over 50 percent of Japan's porcelain ware.\n- Mino Handmade Paper\nMino washi is a traditional papercraft in Gifu. The ancient technique used produces a fine paper that balances thinness with strength and beauty. During the Edo period (1603-1867), this paper was regarded as high-grade shoji paper, and was favored by the shogunate, the last samurai government of Japan.\n## Seasonal Highlights\n- Spring\nBoasting one of the finest displays of cherry blossoms in the country and a spectacular spring festival, Takayama attracts visitors from across Japan and around the world during springtime.\n- Summer\nWatch ukai or cormorant fishing on the Nagara River, camp at the Tsukechi Gorge or hike through some of the most stunning mountains in Japan, including Mt. Hakusan and Mt. Norikura.\n- Autumn\nTake in Takayama's autumn festival and the autumn leaves in the mountains, particularly around Gujo Hachiman. October's Mino Washi Akari Exhibition draws artists from all over to create art using Mino’s famous handmade paper.\n- Winter\nWinter in Gifu is all about snow sports, with Gujo and Takayama the main destinations. Shirakawa-go is especially gorgeous when the traditional thatched houses are blanketed in snow."}

The city played a key role in Japan's unification and has a rich history to discover.\n### Don't Miss\n- Climbing, or riding the ropeway up Mt. Kinka to Gifu Castle\n- Buying celebrated local pottery or make your own in Tajimi\n- Reliving the battle that led to the unification of Japan at Sekigahara\n## How to Get There\nGifu Station is about 30 minutes from Nagoya. From there you can catch trains and buses to all parts of the prefecture.\nGifu-Hashima is a stop on the Tokaido Shinkansen line between Nagoya and Maibara. The adjacent Gifu-Hashima Meitetsu station connects with Gifu Meitetsu Station, a five-minute walk from Gifu Station.\n### A commanding castle\nHigh on Mt. Kinka on the banks of the Nagaragawa River, Gifu Castle has one of the most impressive views of any castle in Japan and was rebuilt to the specifications of the 16th-century original. It takes around an hour to reach it on foot or a few minutes by ropeway. The area around the base of the mountain is packed with shrines, temples and museums.\n### The great Buddha of Shoho-ji Temple\nIn the 19th century, a 14-meter statue of the Buddha was built to honor the victims of earthquakes and the diseases that inevitably followed them. A short walk from the base of Mt. Kinka and Gifu Castle, the Buddha and the temple that houses it are comparable with the great Buddhas of Nara and Kamakura.\n### Dive for your dinner\nDuring Ukai fishing, a centuries old tradition, local master fishermen use cormorants to catch fish and drop them back in the boat. The birds are rewarded with every eighth fish.\nUkai fishing takes place at night by firelight. You can watch from boats that drift alongside the fishermen. Some boats also serve dinner while you watch.\n### A small but elegant castle\nJust 12 minutes by train west of Gifu Station, Ogaki Castle is another concrete reconstruction of a 16th century castle. Ogaki was the closest castle to the battlefield of Sekigahara and was involved heavily in the wars of the 16th century. The museum inside the castle retells the story.\n### Japan's legendary battle\nIn 1600 Tokugawa Ieyasu faced Ishida Mitsunari in what would become the defining battle of Japanese history, the Battle of Sekigahara. The ensuing bloodshed brought to an end the Warring States Period (1467-1603), roughly 150 years of continuous civil war.\nTokugawa won the day, united the country, and began his shogunate, a dynasty that ruled Japan in relative peace for 250 years. Today, the Battle of Sekigahara is commemorated with a fascinating museum in the town center and recreations of the various army camps in the narrow valley.\n### Tajimi and its pottery\nThe town of Tajimi is home to many varieties of world-renowned mino-yaki (mino ware), including Oribe and Shino. There are dozens of shops selling gorgeous dishes, vases and figures in this distinctive local style. You can even make your own bowls and cups at Ceramic Park.\nTajimi is also home to Eiho-ji, a stunning temple complex with one of the most beautiful gardens in Japan. You can easily spend a few hours strolling the gardens and bridges across the pond.\n### The festival of exquisite paper\nEvery October the town of Mino opens its streets to artists from all over the world for the Mino Washi Akari Art Festival. They create beautiful lanterns and light sculptures with hand-made Mino paper.\nThe festival is held in the evenings and the streets of the historic town are awash in soft light.\n### Chasing the best blossoms\nLike everywhere in Japan, the brief cherry blossom season draws throngs of people to picnic, drink and relax under the pink petals. In Gifu, Kamagatani, Shinsakai Riverside, and Usuzumi Park are acknowledged as the best viewing spots.\nYou can stroll alongside the trees, taking in the falling petals and the changing perspective, or settle below the branches and partake in hanami—blossom viewing—which is accompanied with copious food and drink, the highlight of spring in Japan."}

In fact, there are 19 resorts in total scattered primarily around the Gujo, Takayama and Hida areas. Some have onsen onsite or close by, which will make your apres-skiing an even more enjoyable.\n### Don't Miss\n- Staying at a nearby guesthouse and making your stay a multi-day trip\n- Visiting nearby onsen to soothe tired muscles\n- Taking advantage of the lunch tickets most resorts include in their rental prices\n## How to Get There\nGifu's ski resorts are easily acessible by bus or car. Takayama area resorts can be reached by bus or JR train.\nGifu's ski resorts fall into two main groups: those in the south of the prefecture, centered around Gujo, and those in the north around the Takayama and Hida area. The Gujo resorts are all accessible by bus from Nagoya and Gifu (see the websites of each resort for specific details) or by car.\nTakayama can be reached by bus from Matsumoto or by train on the JR Takayama Line from Nagoya Station (2-3 hours) and from Gifu Station (2 hours). From there, buses connect with the resorts (see the websites of each resort for specific details).\n### In the Gujo area\nDue north of Gujo-Hachiman town is a cluster of popular ski and snowboarding destinations, including Dynaland, Hirugano Kogen, Outdoor in Motai, Meiho, Snow Wave Park Shiratori Kogen, Shokawa Kogen, Washigatake, Takasu, White Pia Takasu, and Winghills Shirotori Resort.\n### Dynaland\nLocated about two hours from Nagoya, Dynaland gets incredibly busy on weekends. It boasts 18 separate runs fed by five lifts.\n### Washigatake\nWith 12 runs and five lifts, Washigatake is also well stocked with restaurants and has an onsen onsite.\n### Takasu\nTakasu has 12 separate runs, but it's the snowboarding park that brings the crowds in, with all the rails, pipes and walls you could ask for.\n### Takayama and Hida\nAround the Takayama and Hida area there are two main resort clusters. East of the city, Hounokidaira, Hirayu Onsen and Hida Takayama are popular, particularly for overnight trips, given the wealth of onsen and inns. North of Takayama, Star Spur Ryokufu, Hida Highland, Hida Kawai and Shirakawago Hirase Onsen Shirayumi are always busy on the weekends.\n### Hounokidaira\nWith 16 runs and five lifts, this is the area's main resort. It also features some off-piste areas.\n### Hirayu Onsen\nIt has only three runs, but being a short walk from the bus terminal and the onsen, the inns and hotels of Hirayu Onsen make this ski resort one of the most convenient and least crowded in Gifu.\n### Rentals\nFor the larger or taller skier, it's worth checking on available rental sizes in advance with all resorts, since some only carry boots up to 28 or 29 centimeters and corresponding lengths of skis."}

Once a key crossroads for travelers, it is now a window into a slower and older Japan close enough to major cities for a day trip. There are also 10 ski resorts in the area, and limestone caves to explore. The town is home to a huge and hugely popular Bon Odori dance festival in the Summer.\n### Don't Miss\n- One of Japan's most important traditional dance festivals\n- Making your own plastic food sample at Sample Village Iwasaki\n- Choose from 10 different ski resorts\n## How to Get There\nGujo Hachiman can be reached by train or hourly highway bus from Nagoya.\nTrain: From Gifu Station, take the JR Takayama Line to Mino-Ota Station (about 40 minutes) and change to the local Nagaragawa Railway for Gujo Hachiman. The station is a lengthy but pleasant walk from the town center. From Nagoya, get to Gifu Station first, either on the Tokaido Main Line or on the same JR Takayama Line that continues to Mino-Ota Station.\nBus: Most highway buses from Nagoya and Gifu stop at Gujo Hachiman Inter, and a smaller number stop at the more convenient Gujo Hachiman Jokamachi Plaza.\n### A castle reconstructed in wood, demonstrations of period weaponry\nThe original castle was built in the 16th century atop a hill overlooking the valley, about a 20-minute walk from the town center. Many castles across Japan were destroyed in the 1870s, and Gujo Hachiman was no exception. When it was rebuilt in 1933, however, Gujo Hachiman was reconstructed in wood rather than the concrete used for many other restored castles. It is one of Japan's oldest wooden castle reconstructions.\nGujo Hachiman Castle's location amid maple trees make it one of the most photogenic fortresses in Japan. Volunteers give demonstrations of period weaponry—the small cannons are particularly impressive—and the museum inside the castle tells fascinating tales about the town.\n### A colossal dance festival\nOn 31 nights from July to September, the hills around Gujo Hachiman come alive with the sound of music. Tens of thousands of people descend on Gujo Hachiman for its renowned Gujo Odori Bon Dance Festival.\nWhether you want to dance the night away or just sample some community energy, this event—over 400 years old and based on much older traditions—is recognized as one of the three most important dance festivals in Japan.\n### Make your own fake food samples\nThe food sample displays in the windows of restaurants are ubiquitous in Japan. Gujo Hachiman is a famous manufacturing center of these food replicas. Several of the manufacturers open their doors to visitors and hold workshops where you can make your own sushi, tempura or vegetable samples. Sample Village Iwasaki is the most famous, and reservations are advised.\n### Leaf-peeping\nGujo Hachiman is nestled in a valley surrounded by heavily forested mountains, making it an ideal place to view the fiery autumn leaves. The Momiji Festival runs for a few weeks every November when, despite the chill in the air, people flock to the town. The highlight is the area around the castle, which is lit up at night. The garden at Jionji temple is also gorgeous at this time of year.\n### Spelunking in Otaki's limestone caves\nSouth of the town, this series of caves and caverns includes a 30-meter underground waterfall and some bizarre millennia old stalactites. The 700-meter stretch open to the public takes about 30 minutes to tour.\n### Okumino area ski resorts\nThe Okumino area holds a collection of 10 ski resorts, with direct bus links to Central Japan International Airport. Okumino's convenience, choice of runs, great powder and stunning views draw skiers and snowboarders from across Japan.\n### Sword-ed in Seki\nOnce a center of excellence for samurai sword manufacture, Seki had to shift to manufacturing more common items such as kitchen knives, cutlery and other bladed tools when the Edo period (1603-1867) ended and modernity was ushered in. Today, the tools and other items they produce during the day are prized as souvenirs, and a museum of sword-making with live demonstrations draws in crowds.\nA short walk away the Seki Zenkoji temple–named after its larger, more famous cousin in Nagano City–has a short pilgrimage trail and a pitch-black underground passageway where you can touch the door to the afterlife."}

Ena to the ancient forests and Tsukechi Gorge to the Tokai Nature Path and Lake Nenoue, which make this great trekking territory. Campgrounds are plentiful here as well.\n### Don't Miss\n- Magome, a post town that still feels like 17th-century Japan\n- Hiking along the dramatic Tsukechi Gorge and scaling Mt. Ena\n- Taisho-mura, a glimpse into Japanese life in the 1910s and 1920s\n## How to Get There\nNakatsugawa Station is the area's main transportation hub.\nNakatsugawa is on the JR Chuo Main Line, just under an hour from Nagoya and around two hours from Gifu (change trains in Tajimi). It is within easy reach of Matsumoto Station in Nagano Prefecture.\nFrom there, buses go to all major tourist locations and connect with local towns and villages.\n### Edo life in an old Nakasendo post town\nNakatsugawa was once a post town on the Nakasendo road from Tokyo to Kyoto. Restored Edo period (1603-1867) buildings—including warehouses, sake shops and restaurants—offer a look into Nakatsugawa's past, and the Nakasendo Historical Museum provides context.\nThe grounds around the ruined Naegi Castle and Asahigaoka Park (home to Asahigaoka Shrine and Nanrinji Temple) make for pleasant walks. These days Nakatsugawa is also known as a jumping-off point for exploring other attractions in the area, such as Magome and Taisho-mura, hiking and skiing in the rugged Japan Alps or relaxing in one of the many onsen.\n### Step back centuries at Magome\nAnother old post town on the Nakasendo , Magome, is the highlight of the area. From functioning water wheels to traditional soba restaurants, every aspect of Magome is presented as it would have been in the 17th century.\nConnected to neighboring post town Tsumago by an eight-kilometer path that twists through stunning countryside landscapes. You could easily spend a whole day here taking in the peace and beauty of long-ago Japan.\n### Roaming through the Tsukechi-Kyo Valley\nTsukechi Gorge is a deep gorge in an ancient forest offering great hiking routes and photo opportunities. Consider camping here to enjoy the valley at your own pace and experience the clear, star-strewn skies.\nThe forest is home to the lemon-scented Kiso cypress, a famous and much sought-after wood used in temples and shrines across Japan.\n### These boots were made for walking\nEna is a popular town in the area, with two interesting museums: the Hiroshige Museum of Art, offering woodblock prints from the master and others, and the Hishiya Museum, the restored house of a village headman.\nThe mountains around Ena are another attraction. The Tokai Nature Path leads south through beautiful scenery, including Mt. Ena. The hike up the steep 600-meter trail to the summit is no casual stroll, but the panoramic views from the top are worth the effort.\n### Taisho-mura takes you back a century\nRolling down the scenic Akechi Railroad from Ena, you can open the windows to shoot the scenes outside. The train brings you to Taisho-mura, a village whose buildings date from the Taisho period (1912-1926). The roads leading away from the station are lined with structures from the era.\nYou can learn more about them at Nihon Taisho Mura, a modern museum that re-creates the life of the town in the early 20th century and its then-thriving sericulture industry. You can rent a kimono tailored in the style of the time.\nNear Nihon Taisho Mura is Old Miyake House, a thatched wooden Japanese farmhouse and garden that dates to 1688."}

Norikura\n## How to Get There\nLocated in the center of Japan, Okuhida Onsen can be accessed by public transport from Nagoya, Matsumoto or Takayama.\nFrom Nagoya station, take the Takayama Line to Takayama Station. You can take a one-hour bus from there to Hirayu. From Hirayu, there is a bus line that runs to Fukuji, Shin-Hirayu, Tochi and Shin-Hotaka. Another line runs to Mt. Norikura.\nThe Matusmoto Line bus runs from Matsumoto to Takayama, stopping at Hirayu. There are only a few buses a day so check an up-to-date timetable before traveling.\n### Five hot spring retreats\nOkuhida boasts five picturesque hot spring resorts: Hirayu, Fukuji, Shin-Hirayu, Tochio and Shin-Hotaka. All are conveniently accessible on the same bus route. You can spend the day shuttling between them, sampling baths with different mineral content and competing views.\nAlternatively, stay at one of the hotels or ryokan (traditional inns) and indulge in a multi-course meal of assorted local delicacies.\n### One of the tallest mountains in Japan\nA rugged volcano and among Japan's tallest mountains, Norikura is linked to Hirayu via a road that reaches an elevation of 2,700 meters. The road is closed to public vehicles but buses operate from the Norikura Kogen Tourist Information Center and Hirayu between mid-April and late October.\nThere are many hiking paths around Norikura and the 3,026-meter peak can be reached relatively easily in just 90 minutes from the the 2,700-meter Tatamidaira bus terminal.\n### Over the top in a double decker\nAnother destination in the area is Japan's only double-decker ropeway at Shin-Hotaka, and the ropeway car is as popular with photographers as the views down the mountainside.\nThe sights from the observation deck at the ropeway terminus are spectacular. Reaching 2,150 meters, the ropeway is a convenient way to reach dizzying heights without the effort of a long, difficult hike.\nWith well-signposted trails leading from and around the terminus and a restaurant serving snacks and refreshments, it is easy to spend a leisurely half day in the mountains.\n### Exploring more of the mountains\nTo fully experience the Northern Japan Alps, you can make a day of it, hiking from the ropeway terminus to Nishihotaka Doppyo (2,701 meters) and then down into Kamikochi via the nearby Nishihotakadake Mountain Hut. Be prepared to start early, however, because the total journey takes a full eight hours with few breaks."}

The journey from Nagoya takes about 2 hours 20 minutes, and from Toyama it takes around 1 hour 30 minutes. Highway buses also operate to Takayama from Matsumoto.\n### A festive town\nTakayama is a popular destination year-round but is paticularly busy for the Takayama Festival in spring and autumn.\nOn festival days, the streets throng with visitors and locals who come to watch the festival procession and see the ornate floats. Accommodation can be hard to come by, so booking ahead is essential if you want to be in town to catch either festival.\n### Sanmachi, heart of Takayama\nThe heart of Takayama city, the Sanmachi area of preserved buildings, attracts tourists from all over the country. You could spend a whole day wandering these old streets, buying souvenirs from the many craft shops, sampling local tea and digging into local treats like wagyu sushi.\nA number of sake breweries are also located in and around the Sanmachi district, and tasting is possible.\n### Morning markets\nExplore the two markets, one on the bank of the Miyagawa River and another in front of Takayama Jinya. Every morning, merchants set up their stalls, selling local produce and artisanal craftworks.\n### A smorgasbord for history buffs\nTakayama is a haven for history buffs. Hida Folk Village (Hida-no-Sato) preserves more than 30 historic buildings from the Hida area, including traditional homes with thatched roofs, some steep-angled in the local Gassho-zukuri style.\nTakayama Matsuri Yatai Kaikan displays 4 of the ornately decorated floats that grace the streets during the town-wide festivals. Hida Takayama Town Museum tells the story of Takayama's founding and development, with exhibits on art and writers associated with the town.\n### Peak interest\nHirayu is the western gateway to Kamikochi (Matsumoto performs this role in the east), a hiker's paradise. Private vehicles are not permitted into the park in an effort to protect the natural environment.\nMt. Norikura is another popular hiking destination. To the west of Takayama, Mt. Hakusan is also a favored spot for climbers and nature photographers alike, with stunning waterfalls and lakes around the base of the mountain. Another option is the Shinhotaka Ropeway which takes visitors 2,156 meters above sea level, for views from above the clouds.\n### Thatched village bliss\nFifty minutes by bus north of Takayama is Shirakawa-go, a UNESCO World Heritage site where visitors can wander around verdant gardens and carp-filled ponds. Many of the traditional gassho-zukuri houses are open to the public, and a few function as inns.\n### Hida Furukawa\nHida Furukawa is something of a sibling to Takayama. Downriver and containing many of the same style of restored buildings, it can make for a peaceful escape from its more popular neighbor.\nThirty minutes northeast of Hida Furukawa stands Kamioka Castle. The current structure dates back to 1970 but the original was built on the same site in 1564. Some of the original walls and foundations remain and the castle is now a museum of weapons and armor.\n### Gero Onsen\nAn hour south of Takayama, or two hours north of Nagoya, Gero Onsen is a renowned hot spring resort. Charlie Chaplin visited and his statue stands to commemorate the event. There are three public baths, and the private ones attached to hotels and ryokan are open to the public at certain times of the day.\nIf you crave more than just relaxation, you can stroll the resort, visiting sights such as Onsenji Temple and Gassho Village, a small-scale version of the Hida Folk Village."}

From one of these two points, take a train to Uenoshi Station in downtown Iga.\nThe journey from Osaka, Kyoto or Nagoya takes between 90 minutes and two hours in total.\n### Where ninja once roamed\nThis quiet, inland area of Mie Prefecture, with its small towns and farmland nestled in the mountains, is also historically home to Japan's famous ninja. It was here that the Iga-ryu school developed its mysterious martial art. The ninjas maintained their base in the Iga area for centuries, venturing across the country to act as spies and assassins for samurai warlords.\nThose days are long past, but ninjutsu's stealthy arts are alive and well. If you want to delve into the ways of the ninja, then come and explore the remote forests in western Mie they called home.\nIga City makes a good starting point for learning about the shadow warriors and their history. The Ninja Museum of Igaryu has a maze-like ninja house open for exploration. You can also see ninjutsu masters demonstrate their techniques and test your own warrior aptitude by throwing some razor-sharp ninja weapons.\nAfter the museum, head next door to Iga Ueno Castle from which feudal lords once ruled the area and commanded the local ninja. Rent a ninja costume and spice up your photos by posing in stealth mode.\nContinue your adventure in the secluded mountains to the south where you'll find the Akame 48 Waterfalls. There you can join a ninja training course held on the same terrain where ninja once practiced their arts.\nWhen you're finished, hike out to view some of Akame's fabulous waterfalls while keeping your eyes open for the rare Japanese giant salamander along the river. If you miss one there, you can see one for sure at the Japanese Salamander Center not far from the entrance to the falls.\n### Perfect relaxation for a newbie warrior\nYunoyama Onsen is a hot spring resort where you can unwind with a soothing bath whether you're staying at one of the inns there or just stopping by. A ropeway will take you to the summit of Mt. Gozaisho, where skiing, hiking trails, and panoramic views await."}

Beyond exploring the religious facets of this region, you'll have ample chances to wander historical districts, lounge on sandy beaches, and indulge in local delicacies such as spiny lobster and abalone.\n### Don't Miss\n- The mystical atmosphere of Ise-Jingu\n- Shaved ice from a shop along Oharaimachi-street outside Naiku\n- Lounging on the beach in Toba\n## How to Get There\nThe Ise Bay area is easily reached by Kintetsu Railway from Osaka and Nagoya.\nThe city of Ise is the most common starting point for travel in the area. Ise-shi Station is approximately 1 hour 45 minutes from Osaka, 2 hours from Kyoto and 1.5 hours from Nagoya by Kintetsu limited express. From Nagoya the journey is about 90 minutes.\n### The soul of Japan\nShinto is the Japanese indigenous religion, and Ise-Jingu is composed of 125 shrines including main sanctuaries Naiku and Geku. Naiku is its most sacred site, where Amaterasu Omikami, the deity likened to the sun, is enshrined. You could visit Ise-Jingu and surrounding area as a daytrip but staying overnight will allow you to explore at a more leisurely pace.\n### Geku and Sengukan Museum\nWhile Naiku of Ise-Jingu is its most famous area, Geku and Sengukan Museum about 5 kilometers away are also worth visiting. Both are in central Ise, about a 10-minute walk from Iseshi Station. The architecture of Geku is similar to Naiku, though there are some differences between them.\nThe Sengukan Museum reveals Ise-Jingu's Shikinen Sengu (shrine reclocation) ritual through a variety of exhibits. These include a full sized reconstruction of the structure in which a deity is enshrined, and displays of the instructions to create sacred adornments and treasures for the deities.\n### Naiku\nNaiku is dedicated to the deity Amaterasu Omikami, likened to the sun and mythical ancestor of Japan's successive emperors. It's also said to house a sacred mirror, Yata-no-kagami, a symbol of the deity, which is part of the Imperial regalia.\nOharaimachi-street, outside of Naiku is a long, meandering, old-fashioned street lined with shops and restaurants which is well worth taking time to explore.\nTo enter the precincts of Naiku, cross the wooden Ujibashi Bridge, passing through the torii gates on either side.\nWhile there are many interesting affiliated shrines and other Shinto structures throughout the grounds, the main building of Naiku is largely obscured from public view. However, the solemn atmosphere makes a stroll through the lush natural surroundings an amazing experience.\n### Shopping and dining options\nAfter visiting Ise-Jingu, wander the nearby street of Oharaimachi and Okage Yokocho Square to sample culinary offerings like Ise's uber-thick udon noodles and shaved ice. If you're a green tea aficionado, Ise is famous for its tea, so be sure to have a cup. The area is a good place to pick out special gifts for friends and family back home.\n### Beyond Ise\nWhile Ise is the area's main draw, Matsusaka and Tsu both make for worthwhile visits as well.\nMatsusaka was once a thriving merchant town with a castle that towered over the area, and the walls of the castle remain for sightseers to explore. The city's modern-day claim to fame is the heavily marbled Matsusaka beef that rivals, and some say outdoes, the more well-known Kobe variety. They even make sushi with it. Matsusaka's yakitori, topped with miso, has also gained a stellar reputation among foodies.\nTsu is a great base for excursions to other parts of Mie Prefecture. While in town, don't miss the Mie Prefectural Art Museum that features Western-style art produced by Japanese artists.\nFor sun worshippers and ocean lovers, there are numerous beaches along Ise Bay, particularly in Toba, east of Ise City."}

Buses also service the area, and take about four hours from the Meitetsu Bus Center in Nagoya.\nA combination of trains and buses from Kyoto or Osaka takes roughly 5 hours. The Magose Pass on the old Kumano Kaido Pilgrimage Trail is even farther south, between Aiga and Owase Stations on the Kisei Main Line.\nAs with other parts of rural Japan, a rental car will greatly enhance your ability to explore.\n### Hit the beach\nThe city of Kumano rewards travelers to this distant part of Mie Prefecture with several fun and interesting sights and activities. Head down to the southeastern part of town and you'll find Shichiri Mihama Beach. Spanning 22 kilometers, it is the longest sand and gravel beach in Japan. From here you can see the unusual beak-shaped Onigajo rock formation off to the northeast.\nHead the opposite direction along the beach to reach Hananoiwaya-jinja Shrine, which locals report to be the oldest in the nation. At the shrine, try making a wish on a sacred rock, and if your timing's right, witness the rope renewal ritual that happens every February and October.\n### Fireworks by the sea\nAnother big local event is the Kumano Fireworks Festival held annually on August 17. This is your chance to see a dazzling and creative display as fireworks are launched into the air from boats stationed out at sea. The Onigajo rocks even have a part to play in the show. Stop by and see why.\n### A rest stop for weary pilgrims\nThe hike over Magose Pass is a good place to sample the ancient Kumano Kodo Pilgrimage Trail. Used for centuries to access the sacred sites throughout the area, today it's part of UNESCO's World Heritage sites and Pilgrimage Routes in the Kii Mountain Range. Many consider the five-kilometer hike over the pass one of the most picturesque along the whole trail.\nIf you have extensive hiking planned along the Kumano Kodo, Kumano stands a good chance of being near the beginning or end of your journey. Be sure to take time to appreciate the view of the coast from atop Mt. Tengura, accessible via a path from Magose Pass."}

Inatori Onsen, known for its kinmedai snapper and tsurushi hina dolls, and Atagawa Onsen, which was discovered by samurai Ota Doukan in the 15th century, and has soothed numerous bathers since then. Fishing ports in the area offer some of the freshest seafood in Japan.\n### From black ships to white sands\nShimoda, a port town located at the southern tip of the Izu Peninsula, is the historic place where the black ships led by Commodore Matthew Perry landed, beginning trade wiht the United States after a long period of isolation. Ryosenji temple, where the treaty was signed, is located at the end of Perry Road, a pleasant stroll through the city.\nAlthough Shimoda has an interesting history, it is also popular for its many beaches, such as Shirahama Ohama Beach, which offers some of the best surfing, sand and water sports in Japan. There are also seaside pensions, hotels, and inns all over Shimoda, some with hot springs.\n### Rugged coastlines\nThe southern tip of the Izu Peninsula, as represented by Cape Irozaki, offers rugged seascapes of undulating coastlines and sheer cliffs. The lighthouse here offers excellent views, and you can board a boat that runs around the cape.\n### Heading inland to the highlands and forests\nInland, Izu's natural landscapes are charming as well, such as the lush, green Izu Highlands and the Inland Izu also has its charms, such as the verdant Izu Highlands and Mt Omuro, a distinctly bowl-shaped extinct volcano. Mt. Amagi, Izu's highest vantage point, is actually a series of peaks worth a climb, including Mt. Banjiro and Mt. Banzaburo. This area also has a beautiful waterfall called Joren-no-Taki, with wasabi fields, trout fishing and Shuzenji Onsen.\nWhile you're here, visit one of the many gardens, historical museums, or art galleries featuring the works of Renoir and Picasso.\n### Intriguing islets, Japan's deepest bay, and a cape with a golden glow\nThe zigzagging coastline of Nishi-Izu is one of Japan's most fascinating landforms. The Dogashima Coast from Sebama to Cape Ajo is dotted with oddly shaped rocks and islets such as Sanshirojima and Zojima.\nDogashima Onsen, a seaside hot spring resort with plenty of enticing inns and hotels, has two phenomena nearby worth seeing. One is known as Tombolo—you can walk from the mainland to Sanshiro Island at low tide. The other is a sea cave with a natural skylight that's both serene and mysterious.\nFurther north along the coast is Toi, with a gold mine, fine beaches and onsen of its own. The west coast of Izu faces Suruga Bay, one of the country's greatest treasure troves of seafood. Try some of the fabled sakura ebi, or cherry blossom shrimp, a very local delicacy.\n### To the symbol of Japan, Mt. Fuji\nIzu is a popular day trip destination from Tokyo, but it takes at least a few days to fully enjoy it. If you are staying near Atami, why not take a trip to Japan's most iconic mountain, Mt. Fuji, can be seen from the Izu Peninsula. But nothing compares to seeing it up close."}

Fuji (Shizuoka)\n## Discover great lakes, resorts, onsen and outdoor recreational possibilities around Japan's most fabled peak\nVisible from hundreds of kilometers away yet only a short bullet train ride from Tokyo, Mt. Fuji draws visitors from the world over who come to see and sometimes climb the famous peak. What many travelers don't know is that there are other natural attractions, fantastic recreational possibilities, historic sites and shopping options around the base of this iconic mountain.\nTo the north, for example, the Fuji Five Lakes are a regular destination for outdoor enthusiasts, particularly people into trekking and water sports. The vast Asagiri Highland region to the west offers similar options. And onsen are scattered throughout the area, many with magnificent views of the mountain.\nFor something completely different, head to nearby Gotemba, site of Japan's biggest premium outlet shopping mall.\n### Don't Miss\n- Shiraito Falls—one of the most scenic and unusual waterfalls in Japan\n- Soaking in an onsen with a view of Japan's iconic peak\n- Izu Shaboten Zoo, a quirky mix of zoo and cactus preserve\n- The Asagiri Highland area for outdoor pursuits\n## How to Get There\nMt. Fuji and its environs are reachable by bus, train, car and air.\nTrains from major stations along the Tokaido Shinkansen route—including Tokyo, Nagoya and Osaka—run to Shizuoka and Shin-Fuji stations, and slower trains go to Fuji, Fujinomiya and Gotemba stations.\nMany highway buses connect Tokyo and Shizuoka as well as individual sightseeing spots around Mt. Fuji. Buses operate between Shin-Fuji, Fujinomiya and the Fuji Five Lakes stations, stopping at sights such as Shiraito Falls along the way. Mt. Fuji Shizuoka Airport, handles flights from Sapporo, Okinawa, Fukuoka and Kagoshima, as well as international destinations such as Seoul, Taipei and a few major cities in China.\n### Quick Facts\nMany people scale Mt. Fuji at night to see the sunrise, known as goraiko\nMt. Fuji's original crater is known as Yukyu, or \"Shrine of the Depths\"\nFujisan Hongu Sengen Taisha was built to appease an angry Mt. Fuji\nThe nearby Gotemba Premium Outlets is Japan's largest shopping complex\n### Staying cool at the Fuji Five Lakes, and other amusements\nPeople head for the Mt. Fuji area in droves throughout the year, but the traffic is especially high in summer as urbanites escape the city heat and humidity. The Fuji Five Lakes arrayed around the northern side of the mountain— Kawaguchiko, Saiko, Yamanakako, Shojiko and Motosuko—are prime water sport, cycling and hiking destinations. You'll find onsen, amusement parks like Fuji-Q Highland and the most-trafficked trail up Mt. Fuji on the Yamanashi side as well.\n### Nature all year here\nWith cherry blossoms and azaleas in the spring, lavender and hydrangeas in the summer, colored leaves in the fall and snowfall in the winter, the mountain's skirts are constantly changing color. No matter when you're visiting, the Mt. Fuji area will be showcasing some of Japan's beautiful scenery.\n### Culture ancient and modern\nThe venerable Kitaguchihongu Fuji Sengen shrines associated with Mt. Fuji draw a constant stream of visitors, and are a traditional starting point for climbing the mountain. A 10-minute walk from Fujinomiya Station, Fujisan Hongu Sengen Taisha's origins date back to BCE, although the current structures were built in the 17th century.\nLocated east of the mountain, Fuji Speedway, presents a modern contrast. Site of many major auto-racing events, the speedway can be reached via bus from Gotemba Station.\nThe Gotemba Premium Outlets, one of Japan's flagship shopping discount malls and boasting over 200 stores, is a more recent attraction in the area.\n### Southern charms and summer outdoor fun\nOn the Shizuoka side of Mt. Fuji, you can explore natural phenomena such as Shiraito Falls and Asagiri Highland. Shiraito Falls is one of the area's most mesmerizing attractions, formed from Mt. Fuji snowmelt and named for its cascading “silken thread” waters that fall from a 20-meter-high cliff spanning 150 meters.\nAsagiri Highland—Asagiri means “morning mist”—is a popular summer resort with broad meadows, dairy farms, camping sites, golf courses and paragliding schools. Lake Tanuki here is a good spot for cycling, camping and fishing.\n### Animals on parade, and cacti\nSituated just south of Mt. Fuji, Fuji Safari Park is a popular zoo where the animals roam free in environments that approximate their natural habitat. You can observe the creatures—including lions, tigers, bears, giraffes, cheetahs, elephants, rhinoceroses, zebras and bison—from private vehicles or special buses, and on a nature trail.\nIzu Shaboten Zoo is another fun possibility—an odd combination of a zoo and a cactus garden—that's especially good if you're traveling with kids, since many of the animals can be touched and even held.\n### Making Shizuoka tourism greener\nYou've got more green tourism options thanks to an initiative called Fuji-no-Kuni, meaning “Mt. Fuji Country.” Shizuoka Prefecture has over 50 locations where you can try your hand at various arts and crafts, participate in outdoor excursions and experience a traditional Japanese inn or restaurant."}

It's also where Tokugawa Ieyasu—the shogun who reunified Japan in 1600—grew up and lived out his final years. Many reminders of his presence remain, including Sunpu Castle Park.\nThe city's environs include Miho-no-Matsubara Pine Grove, a seaside pine grove with views of Mt. Fuji noted by poets and artists, and Nihondaira Plateau, which overlooks the Pacific and tea farms. Shizuoka also has beautiful shrines connected to the Tokugawa clan−Shizuoka Sengen and Kunozan Toshogu Shrine. The latter is where Tokugawa Ieyasu rests.\nIf you're into shopping, dining and nightlife, head for the city's extensive shopping complexes. One of them, S-Pulse Dream Plaza, has a theme park and a museum dedicated to sushi.\n### Don't Miss\n- Nihondaira Plateau's rolling hills, offering spectacular views, as well as home to Kunozan Toshogu Shrine\n- The well-preserved Mariko and Utsunoya post stations on the old Tokaido route\n- Miho-no-Matsubara Pine Grove, an extensive area along a beach with a stunning view of Mt.

Various dishes and snacks incorporate tea, including soba, gelato, and waffles filled with matcha cream.\nThere are teahouses all over the city, and the experience of leisurely imbibing tea is a quintessentially Japanese joy. The tea itself comes in a multitude of variations, so be sure to sample as many as possible to find your preferred brew. If you'd like to pick your own tea, May is the best time.\n### Shogun territory\nSumpu Castle in Shizuoka is where the man who united Japan and went on to found a feudal family dynasty that lasted nearly three centuries—shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu—spent both his formative and final years. Sumpu Park, located within the castle walls, features an Ieyasu-inspired Shizuoka Festival complete with cherry blossom dances during the first weekend in April.\nShizuoka Sengen Shrine, west of Sumpu Park, is the collective name for a group of three shrines, the Kambe Shrine, Asama Shrine, and Ohtoshimioya Shrine, all lacquered a rich red. The shrine grounds also have a massive pond.\nMany items associated with the Tokugawa clan and Ieyasu, including a suit of his armor, are housed in the Shizuoka Museum of Cultural Assets on the grounds here.\n### When a plateau is not a plateau\nNihondaira Plateau was at one time flat enough to be called as such, but nature had other plans and pushed the land up into hills. Be glad it did, because the vistas of tea plants, the Pacific and nearby Mt. Fuji are more spectacular as a result.\nNearby, via ropeway, is Kunozan Toshogu Shrine, the magnificent shrine where Tokugawa Ieyasu is buried. It was built in the Gongen-zukuri style reminiscent of Nikko, in which a stone-paved room connects the main hall and worship hall.\n### A scene painted and praised by artists and poets\nThere's a stretch of coastline known as Miho-no-Matsubara Pine Grove near the city that has been celebrated in pictures and poems for centuries. One look and you'll see why—this pine grove runs alongside the sea and offers an unforgettable view of Mt. Fuji. The area is on the UNESCO World Heritage list as part of Japan's Mt. Fuji cultural site.\n### More treats in store\nBesides the fresh and delectable seafood taken from Suruga Bay and the seas surrounding it, Shizuoka is famous for its other produce, including strawberries, sweet mikan oranges, vegetables, and wasabi—the spicy condiment that accompanies many Japanese dishes, including sushi.\nProbably the most unusual fare here is the sakura ebi or cherry shrimp, the sweet and succulent little crustaceans that are primarily found in Suruga Bay. Be sure to try some while you're in Shizuoka."}

You can also access Minobu by bus from Shinjuku Expressway Bus Terminal in around three and a half hours.\n### Climb a staircase into the sky at Minobusan Kuonji Temple\nKuon-ji Temple and its surroundings are a magical escape from the bustle of modern Japanese cities. Minobusan Kuonji's temple gate is one of the largest in Japan, and access to the main temple is by a steep stone staircase.\n### Akasawa village lost in time deep in the mountains of Yamanashi\nIt takes time and effort to get to Akasawa, but once there, you will be rewarded with spectacular mountain vistas. Although there used to be over a dozen inns that served pilgrims who walked from Minobusan Kuonji Temple to Keishin Temple, only one is open today.\nHowever, the other inns are lovingly maintained to give this picturesque village its charm. Expect to hear the call of deer as the sun goes down.\n### Book a room at the oldest hotel in the world\nIf you choose to stay a night at Nishiyama Onsen Keiunkan, you will have access to hot spring baths that have soothed the aches and pains of the who's who of Japan's illustrious elite—from Empresses to military commanders.\nTake the opportunity to relax in the very place where Japan's most powerful historical figures sought refuge.\n### The Mt. Minobu to Mt. Shichimen pilgrimage\nFollowing an ancient pilgrimage route, start your hike at the base of Mt. Minobu by walking through the large sanmon gate and climbing the steep 287-step staircase to Minobusan Kuonji Temple. The ascent of Mt. Minobu, which really begins behind the main temple at Kuon-ji, is punctuated by ancient graveyards, temples, and shrines.\n### The ancient village\nAfter you have reached the summit of the mountain and visited the mountain-top temple, descend to the ancient village of Akasawa.\n### Mt. Fuji views at Mt. Shichimen\nThe village, with its inns, green tea fields and dramatic mountain vistas, is an unforgettable delight. Before you ascend Mt. Shichimen, shower under one of the dramatic waterfalls near the entrance to the mountain. Be sure to see the sunrise over Mt. Fuji from the temple gate at the summit of Mt. Shichimen."}

Fuji (Yamanashi)", "category": "destination", "text": "# YAMANASHIMt. Fuji (Yamanashi)Experience the ancient pilgrimage to the summit of Mt. Fuji\n- Mt. Fuji (Yamanashi)\n## Experience the ancient pilgrimage to the summit of Mt. Fuji\nDuring the Edo period (1603-1867), followers of the Fuijiko faith would embark on a pilgrimage from Edo (modern-day Tokyo) to the top of Mt. Fuji on foot. The trail is still very popular today.\n### Don't Miss\n- Stay overnight on Mt. Fuji and then climb to the top to see the sunrise\n- Reserve proper trekking gear from La Mont, which has a shop in Kawaguchiko, to be delivered to you at the Yoshida Trail 5th Stations\n- During the climbing season at night, look at the northeast side of Mt. Fuji and you will see thousands of climbers' lights twinkling like a glow worm\n## How to Get There\nMt. Fuji is located in southeastern Yamanashi near the border of Shizuoka, accessible by JR train or bus from Shinjuku Station.\nTake an express train on the JR Chuo Line, and change at Otsuki Station for the privately-run Fuji Kyuko Line (JR Rail Pass not accepted). Alternatively, you can take a bus to Kawaguchiko Station from Shin-Fuji Station (2 hours and 15 minutes) or Mishima Station (1.5 hours), which are both on the JR Tokaido Shinkansen Line.\nMt. Fuji Station (Fujisan Station) is the closest station to the Yoshida Trail. Once you arrive at either Mt. Fuji Station (Fujisan Station) or Kawaguchiko Station, you can get a bus to Mt. Fuji 5th Station. You can also get to Mt. Fuji 5th Station via bus from Shinjuku Expressway Bus Terminal in just under 2.5 hours. The bus journey to Kawaguchiko Station takes almost 2 hours.\n### Kitaguchi Hongu Fuji Sengen-jinja Shrine\nThe historic entrance to Mt. Fuji, located at Kitaguchi Hongu Fuji Sengen-jinja Shrine, is a must see for those who plan to climb the sacred volcano. Proceed slowly along the approach to the shrine in order to study the moss-covered stone lanterns lining your way. The enormous gate (Fujisan Ootorii) marks your departure from this world and your arrival in the world of the sacred.\n### Thousand-year-old trees surrounding the shrine\nPay particular attention to the massive Japanese cedars that surround the shrine. These thousand-year-old trees stand as a testament to the ancient practice of venerating Mt. Fuji. Taro is the name of the tree at the front of the shrine, while Jiro, his twin, can be seen at the back.\n### The Yoshida Trail\nAlthough it is still possible to walk directly from the back of Kitaguchi Hongu Fuji Sengen-jinja Shrine to the top of Mt. Fuji, the path between the shrine and Umagaeshi, the entrance to the Yoshida Trail, has been lost to time. It is still possible to start the ascent of Mt. Fuji from the shrine, but a GPS feature on your smartphone will be indispensable to ensure you stay on course.\n### Bus to Umagaeshi during climbing season\nOnce you arrive at the entrance to Umagaeshi, you will be greeted by a pair of stone monkeys guarding the gate. Enter here to climb to Mt. Fuji 5th Station in virtual undisturbed silence. For the less intrepid climber, there is a bus that departs Mt. Fuji Station (Fujisan Station) for Umagaeshi during the climbing season (July and August).\nExperienced climbers ascending Mt. Fuji outside the official climbing season (July 1 to September 10) do so at their own risk\n### Mt. Fuji's 5th Station\nAs your peaceful ascent to Mt. Fuji's 5th station draws to a close, savor the last moments just before you encounter the dozens of expressway buses that have arrived via the Fuji Subaru Line. Now you can resupply for the most challenging part of the climb. Remember that you will be ascending beyond the tree line, so it's going to get much cooler, especially at night. You will be able to access many services at the 5th station, so be sure to have a look around before you continue your ascent of Mt. Fuji.\n### Make sure you're prepared\nTake this opportunity to send a postcard or ask any final questions of the tourist information staff. Be sure to have warm clothing, rain gear, and a good pair of hiking boots as Mt. Fuji can become a very inhospitable place in a sudden downpour.\n### The Yoshida Fire Festival\nEach year, on the night of August 26, the Chinka Taisai is held to prevent Mt. Fuji from erupting. This 400-year-old festival is also known as the mountain's closing festival. At the festival, three-meter-high bonfires are lit along the national road leading to the base of Mt. Fuji. These fires are an offering to Mt. Fuji, the God of Fire. This festival is one of Japan's greatest.\n### Fujisan World Heritage Center\nThe exhibits tell the story of how Mt. Fuji became both a sacred place of worship and an artistic inspiration to the Japanese people. Pay particular attention to the the small dioramas that depict the ascent of Mt. Fuji in ancient times. The center offers multilingual audio guidance in English, Chinese, Korean, Thai and Indonesian. You can also get tourist information about Mt. Fuji and the surrounding area."}
