Animators Studio Ghibli are slated to open a theme park in the prefecture in 2022.\n## How to Get There\nLocated in the middle of Honshu, Nagoya is a key transportation hub.

It also gives you a marvellous vantage point for viewing the area's spectacular cherry blossoms in spring or maple trees in autumn.\nBuilt by the uncle of Oda Nobunaga (1534–1582), the castle's old wooden steps are polished smooth from generations of footsteps.\n### The teahouse of a feudal lord\nInuyama also has one of the finest examples of a teahouse from the golden age of tea in the 16th century, Jo-an, built by Nobunaga's brother Uraku and considered a masterpiece of early Edo period architecture. The attached Urakuen Garden is an example of the artistry of the age.\nWhile you amble through the bamboo groves and down Jo-an's stone-paved paths, you can sense the stillness and serenity that the Japanese art of tea instills. And no wonder: Uraku was one of the seven leading disciples of Sen-no-Rikyu, considered an outstanding master of tea ceremony in Japan and the father of the tradition of wabi-sabi, which is based on the acceptance of transience and imperfection.\n### Enjoy the festivities\nInuyama Festival is one of Aichi's most spectacular. Its 8-meter-tall wooden floats are pulled through the town by locals and heaved around street corners. Try not to fear for the flute-playing children within as the floats seem close to toppling to the ground.\nAt night, the floats are lit up with hundreds of paper lanterns that cast a flickering glow upon the cherry trees that line the old streets.\n### A festival that celebrates life\nFor a singular cultural experience, another nearby festival that you certainly shouldn't miss is the Honen Festival. The highlight of this March 15 event is an approximately 300-kilo phallus being pulled through the streets of the small castle town of Komaki. You'll be invited to indulge in free glasses of sake as the locals pray for a good harvest in the coming year.\nThe scene for most of the festival is Tagata Jinja, which also features other examples of manmade phalluses. The large phallus is carved new every year from a cypress log.\n### Museums out in the open\nExplore revolutionary times around the world and in Japan at Inuyama's remarkable open-air museums. At the Little World Museum of Man, for example, you can visit a Korean farmhouse, an opulent Peruvian home, a Burkinabe compound and a Swedish Sami tent in a family-friendly celebration of cultures from all over the world.\nMeiji Mura, on the other hand, reflects life in the culturally tumultuous Meiji period. You can see how Western culture inspired Japanese architects as the nation moved from its samurai past into the modern era."}

From JR Nagoya Station it's around 20 minutes via the Hikari bullet train.\n### Witness one-of-a-kind, dramatic fireworks\nIn summer, visitors can experience the explosive sounds of fireworks being shot into the air in Toyohashi. The castle city is the birthplace of handheld tezutsu fireworks—the dramatic scale of the Toyohashi Gion Festival is difficult to find anywhere else.\nDuring the event, over 450-year-old tezutsu cannons send spectacular sparks into the air, which cascade down like waterfalls. You can also learn to perform the ‘bamboo grass dance,' unique to the region.\n### Sea monsters be gone\nTo ward off sea monsters, these amazingly gigantic lanterns had to be imposing. The Lantern Festival (Ochochin Matsuri) was started to keep the terrifying monsters at bay. Today you can witness how the festival, with its 6- to 10-meter-tall paper lanterns, has grown into a spellbinding demonstration of local pride and artistry.\n### Foxes as far as the eye can see\nToyokawa Inari is a Buddhist temple that has fused both Shinto and Buddhist practices. It enshrines a deity astride a white fox carrying an ear of rice along with the main deity. Walk around the vast temple grounds amid thousands of stone statues of foxes wearing red aprons.\n### An island shrine of romance\nRising out of Mikawa Bay, the entirety of the dome-shaped island of Takeshima is a sanctuary. After crossing the bridge, explore the island and discover shrines hidden among the coves.\nIn the middle of the island you will find Yaotomi Shrine. It is believed that worshiping here brings good luck in marriage and childbirth. The shrine is dedicated to Benten (or Benzaiten), the goddess of entertainment and marriage.\n### One of Aichi's best amusement parks\nAt Lagunasia, part of Laguna Ten Bosch, enjoy rides and attractions including roller coasters, boat rides, and a 65-meter-high Ferris wheel. There are also six swimming pools and a shopping complex.\n### A historic castle\nAs a post town with lodging along the historic Old Tokaido Highway from Kyoto to Edo (Tokyo), Toyohashi is steeped in history, and was depicted in many classic woodblock prints in the Edo period. One popular subject for these works was Yoshida Castle. Today you can wander the ruins of the castle or climb to the top of the reconstructed Kurogane Yagura, one of the castle's towers.\nCharming all year round, Yoshida Castle takes on an extra beauty in spring when the surrounding cherry blossoms are in bloom."}

It has extensive retail shops and great restaurants where you can sample many of the delights of the city without ever leaving the station.\nNagoya is famed for its full-flavored, piquant cuisine, and throughout the station area you can find fantastic restaurants dishing up peppery chicken wings, succulent red miso pork cutlets, and spicy \"Taiwan\" ramen.\n### Taste the culture and then the food\nThe great warlords Oda Nobunaga, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, and Tokugawa Ieyasu, the three most famous samurai in Japanese history, all have origins in Nagoya and played a part in reunifying Japan after a century of civil war.\nHideyoshi was born in what is now Nagoya, as was Nobunaga, who made Nagoya Castle his home. Ieyasu was born in Okazaki Castle in Aichi prefecture (Nagoya's prefecture), and the legacy of the most important sub-branch of the Tokugawa Clan lives on in the Tokugawa Art Museum, which continues to be managed by the family foundation.\nThough the castle at Kiyosu is the oldest in the area, it is the towering Nagoya Castle that is the symbol of the city. Walking its grounds while chatting with \"samurai warlords\" dressed in full armor will give you a taste of the historical importance of the city.\n©Nagoya Convention & Visitors Bureau\n### Dancing and sumo, clothing optional\nNo matter what time of year you are in central Nagoya, you are bound to come across a major spectacle, event or festival.

Within 15 minutes of the station you can see the galaxy and beyond in the world's largest planetarium at the City Science Museum, learn about the history of Aichi's most famous company at the Toyota Commemorative Museum of Industry and Technology, or discover samurai culture at the Tokugawa Art Museum.\n©Nagoya Convention & Visitors Bureau\n©Nagoya Convention & Visitors Bureau\n### A city in bloom\nDespite it being a thriving city center, in late March everyone stops what they are doing to enjoy the glorious cherry blossoms. To join the lively party, head over to Tsuruma Park, the Nagoya Castle grounds or nearby Meijo Park.\n### Shop until the lights stop shining\nWhether you head to the station for its upmarket department stores, Sakae for its high street shopping, or Osu for its 400-year-old commercial arcade, there are plenty of opportunities for all your shopping needs.\n©Nagoya Convention & Visitors Bureau"}

The center of Japan's manufacturing power, it's known for industrial and historic power—celebrated in the form of great museums—as well as a grand zoo and botanical gardens, Legoland and a revered shrine that houses one of the country's three Imperial regalia. The city's proximity to Kyoto, Osaka and Tokyo make it a convenient stop.\n### Don't Miss\n- Building on your imagination at Legoland\n- One of the country's best cherry blossom spots\n- The city's great zoo and aquarium\n## How to Get There\nNagoya is one of Japan's central transit points, making it simple to get to the city from almost anywhere in the country.\nFrom Tokyo, the bullet train takes just one hour and 40 minutes, and from Kyoto it's 35 minutes.\n### One of Japan's most revered shrines, and a singular treasure\nJapan's second largest shrine, Atsuta-jingu Shrine, holds a singular treasure known as the Sword of Kusanagi, one of Japan's three Imperial regalia. As you wander around the main shrine's sprawling, sun-dappled, thousand-year-old cedar groves, you will also discover many hidden shrines within secluded copses.\nIn June, the shrine is lit by the lamps of the Kento Makiwara floats, and you can watch a variety of traditional Japanese performing arts at the Atsuta Festival. During New Year's, join the thousands of locals who flock to the shrine to pray for good fortune in the coming year.\n### Beautiful, bountiful blossoms along the riverside\nSpringtime is an excellent time to be in and around Nagoya. Plum blossoms and cherry blossoms cover the city in the white, pink and red of their blooms. For the best views, walk along the Yamazakigawa Riverside or take a stroll around the Botanical Gardens of Higashiyama Zoo.\n©Nagoya Convention & Visitors Bureau\n### One of Asia's biggest attractions, and the world's biggest outdoor pool\nIn fact, the Higashiyama Zoo and Botanical Gardens has more to offer than its cherry trees. As you amble through its extensive grounds, you'll find some of its 7,000 plant species and make friends with many of the 550 animals that call the zoo home, including a gorilla famous for its good looks. Nagoya Port Aquarium is one of Japan's biggest and best, and holds shows in the world's largest outdoor pool.\n©Nagoya City Higashiyama Zoo & Botanical Gardens\n### Building blocks of fun at Legoland\nAn even more magnetic draw for kids is Legoland Japan. Ride and play at over 40 different attractions, learn how to build amazing constructions, and wonder at how they managed to put together some 10,000 different models from 17 million Lego blocks.\n### From roads to rails, Nagoya is central to Japan\nThe city's marvelous museums celebrate Nagoya's status as Japan's main hub of industry and transport. At the Toyota Automobile Museum, you can see more than 140 beautifully maintained cars from the birth of motoring to the present day, and everything from family cars to luxury models, historic classics to modern super cars. The Toyota Corporation has more than one museum in the Nagoya area, and there are tours of the facility available.\nOff the roads and on to the rails, at the SCMaglev and Railway Park you can climb in and under a collection of 39 retired train cars, and even drive some them in simulators. From steam locomotives to the newest designs of the magnetically levitated bullet train, you'll gain an appreciation of train travel in Japan."}

One fantastic way to see the influence and prosperity that the company has brought to the area is to visit the Toyota Kaikan Museum.\nThe company is also the sponsor of the city's stadium, a venue for the 2019 Rugby World Cup and home of local soccer team Nagoya Grampus. Sports fans will not want to miss the electric atmosphere of the games at Toyota Stadium.\n### History and beauty hand in hand\nThe nearby city of Okazaki is a haven for those with an interest in samurai history, with its castle the birthplace of the great shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu. Take in the view from the top of the castle keep, meet ‘samurai warriors' within the grounds, or walk in the warlord's footsteps around the adjoining park, ranked as one of Japan's top 100 cherry blossom sites.\n### Autumnal grace and fabulous festival\nIn fall, head for Korankei Gorge in Toyota City during November's Korankei Maple Festival to see the 4,000 maple trees as they turn to a vibrant red. Possibly one of the most beautiful of autumn views in the entire Chubu region.\nLocated in the mountains east of Toyota, Yuya hot springs offers an attractive, authentic townscape nestled in the hillside. Nearby is Mt. Horaiji, an area of unspoiled natural beauty and tranquil spiritualism.\nWhether hiking to the top of the Mt. Horaiji or just half way up to Horaiji Temple, with its vistas of the valley below, listen carefully for the distinctive ‘bu-po-so' calls of the Eurasian scops owl.\n### Step back in time\nThough Toyota is the epitome of modern Japanese manufacturing, at Sanshu Asuke Yashiki near Korankei Gorge, learn how things used to be done. With a step back in time, this open-air museum demonstrates the handiworks of yesterday, including the production of paper umbrellas, bamboo handicrafts, and weaving.\nAfter watching the masters at work, put your own skills to the test by making straw sandals or weaving bamboo."}

The prefecture is served by local JR trains and highway buses as well. There are many domestic and international flights to Chubu Centrair International Airport for easy access to southern Gifu, and some domestic flights to Toyama Airport for service to the northeast.\nNagoya is the main jump-off point for Gifu Prefecture, with the JR Takayama Line providing service to Gifu City, Gero, Takayama and most of the other key places in Gifu.

Highway buses run from Tokyo and Osaka to Takayama Bus Center.\n### Don’t Miss\n- The riot of color and music during Takayama's spring and autumn festivals\n- Thatched-roof houses in Shirakawa-go and Gokayama\n- The soothing waters of Gero Onsen, considered one of Japan's best\n- The world-renowned swordsmiths of Seki and the ancient tradition of cormorant fishing on the Nagara River\n## Explore Gifu by Area\n- \\\\\nNakatsugawa ＆ Around\n- \\\\\nGifu City & Around\n- \\\\\nGujo Hachiman\n- \\\\\nOkuhida\n- \\\\\nHida Takayama\n- \\\\\nGifu Ski Resorts\n## Trending Attractions in Gifu\n- Shirakawa-go AreaShirakawa-go Area\\\\\nShirakawa-go\n- Namonaki Ike aka Monet Pond\\\\\nMonet's Pond\n- Takayama Festival\\\\\nTakayama Spring Festival\n- Magome-juku\\\\\nMagome (Nakasendo)\n- Sanno-machi Historic District\\\\\nSanmachi Historic District\n## Local Specialties\n- Hida Shunkei Lacquerware\nThe natural beauty of wood grain is preserved using the 400-year-old technique known as Shunkei lacquer. Cypress and horse chestnut are often used to create an array of utilitarian objects. Once coated in Shunkei lacquer, they become both beautiful and durable, granting them a long life that only serves to enhance their appearance.\n- Gifu Paper Lanterns\nPaper, bamboo, wood and patience: the materials needed to create the beautiful Gifu-chochin lanterns designated as a national craft for over 20 years. Hand-painted on delicate washi paper, fitted to a weightless bamboo skeleton, the decorative lanterns emit a warm and welcoming glow.\n- Ichii Wood Carving\nMade from yew, the prefectural tree of Gifu, ichii ittobori is a traditional form of carving in Hida, crafted using only chisels and left unstained. Master sculptors hew objects that delicately bring attention to this wood’s fine grain.\n- Kuri Kinton\nKuri kinton is a dish of boiled chestnuts that are greated, booked, and candied with a little sugar. After cooking, the chestnuts are squeezed one by one. The dish itself has a mild sweetness.\n- Ayu\nThe ayu or sweetfish can be found in the waters of the Nagara River in Gifu, and a traditional method of catching them is to use cormorants. In season from summer to autumn, ayu are best eaten after grilling over an open flame with just a sprinkling of salt.\n- Fuyu Persimmons\nFuyu persimmons have no core, seeds or tannins, a texture similar to a pear, and the subtle flavors of dates, brown sugar and cinnamon. You can peel and slice these vibrant orange fruits just like an apple.\n- Keichan\nThe seasoning for this dish can be miso, soy sauce, or salt-based depending on the region. It features chicken thighs stir-fried with cabbage. Often served on a bed of pan-fried noodles, keichan is a warm and comforting dish.\n- Hida Beef\nHida beef is known for its marbling and a layer of fat that retains the aroma and juices of the meat when grilled. You'll know that the meat is tender and well marbled because you can separate it using only chopsticks.\n- Seki Blades\nSeki hamono are forged blades produced in Seki. Bladesmithing there dates back to the 13th century, when craftsmen began making swords. When the end of the feudal era ushered in a new age, those craftsmen began producing kitchen knives and other cutlery instead of samurai weaponry.\n- Mino Ware\nMino yaki is porcelain made in Tono. There are fifteen different types, with the most popular styles being oribe, shino and kizeto ware. This tradition, which likely dates back to the 7th century, now produces over 50 percent of Japan's porcelain ware.\n- Mino Handmade Paper\nMino washi is a traditional papercraft in Gifu. The ancient technique used produces a fine paper that balances thinness with strength and beauty. During the Edo period (1603-1867), this paper was regarded as high-grade shoji paper, and was favored by the shogunate, the last samurai government of Japan.\n## Seasonal Highlights\n- Spring\nBoasting one of the finest displays of cherry blossoms in the country and a spectacular spring festival, Takayama attracts visitors from across Japan and around the world during springtime.\n- Summer\nWatch ukai or cormorant fishing on the Nagara River, camp at the Tsukechi Gorge or hike through some of the most stunning mountains in Japan, including Mt. Hakusan and Mt. Norikura.\n- Autumn\nTake in Takayama's autumn festival and the autumn leaves in the mountains, particularly around Gujo Hachiman. October's Mino Washi Akari Exhibition draws artists from all over to create art using Mino’s famous handmade paper.\n- Winter\nWinter in Gifu is all about snow sports, with Gujo and Takayama the main destinations. Shirakawa-go is especially gorgeous when the traditional thatched houses are blanketed in snow."}

The city played a key role in Japan's unification and has a rich history to discover.\n### Don't Miss\n- Climbing, or riding the ropeway up Mt. Kinka to Gifu Castle\n- Buying celebrated local pottery or make your own in Tajimi\n- Reliving the battle that led to the unification of Japan at Sekigahara\n## How to Get There\nGifu Station is about 30 minutes from Nagoya. From there you can catch trains and buses to all parts of the prefecture.\nGifu-Hashima is a stop on the Tokaido Shinkansen line between Nagoya and Maibara. The adjacent Gifu-Hashima Meitetsu station connects with Gifu Meitetsu Station, a five-minute walk from Gifu Station.\n### A commanding castle\nHigh on Mt. Kinka on the banks of the Nagaragawa River, Gifu Castle has one of the most impressive views of any castle in Japan and was rebuilt to the specifications of the 16th-century original. It takes around an hour to reach it on foot or a few minutes by ropeway. The area around the base of the mountain is packed with shrines, temples and museums.\n### The great Buddha of Shoho-ji Temple\nIn the 19th century, a 14-meter statue of the Buddha was built to honor the victims of earthquakes and the diseases that inevitably followed them. A short walk from the base of Mt. Kinka and Gifu Castle, the Buddha and the temple that houses it are comparable with the great Buddhas of Nara and Kamakura.\n### Dive for your dinner\nDuring Ukai fishing, a centuries old tradition, local master fishermen use cormorants to catch fish and drop them back in the boat. The birds are rewarded with every eighth fish.\nUkai fishing takes place at night by firelight. You can watch from boats that drift alongside the fishermen. Some boats also serve dinner while you watch.\n### A small but elegant castle\nJust 12 minutes by train west of Gifu Station, Ogaki Castle is another concrete reconstruction of a 16th century castle. Ogaki was the closest castle to the battlefield of Sekigahara and was involved heavily in the wars of the 16th century. The museum inside the castle retells the story.\n### Japan's legendary battle\nIn 1600 Tokugawa Ieyasu faced Ishida Mitsunari in what would become the defining battle of Japanese history, the Battle of Sekigahara. The ensuing bloodshed brought to an end the Warring States Period (1467-1603), roughly 150 years of continuous civil war.\nTokugawa won the day, united the country, and began his shogunate, a dynasty that ruled Japan in relative peace for 250 years. Today, the Battle of Sekigahara is commemorated with a fascinating museum in the town center and recreations of the various army camps in the narrow valley.\n### Tajimi and its pottery\nThe town of Tajimi is home to many varieties of world-renowned mino-yaki (mino ware), including Oribe and Shino. There are dozens of shops selling gorgeous dishes, vases and figures in this distinctive local style. You can even make your own bowls and cups at Ceramic Park.\nTajimi is also home to Eiho-ji, a stunning temple complex with one of the most beautiful gardens in Japan. You can easily spend a few hours strolling the gardens and bridges across the pond.\n### The festival of exquisite paper\nEvery October the town of Mino opens its streets to artists from all over the world for the Mino Washi Akari Art Festival. They create beautiful lanterns and light sculptures with hand-made Mino paper.\nThe festival is held in the evenings and the streets of the historic town are awash in soft light.\n### Chasing the best blossoms\nLike everywhere in Japan, the brief cherry blossom season draws throngs of people to picnic, drink and relax under the pink petals. In Gifu, Kamagatani, Shinsakai Riverside, and Usuzumi Park are acknowledged as the best viewing spots.\nYou can stroll alongside the trees, taking in the falling petals and the changing perspective, or settle below the branches and partake in hanami—blossom viewing—which is accompanied with copious food and drink, the highlight of spring in Japan."}

In fact, there are 19 resorts in total scattered primarily around the Gujo, Takayama and Hida areas. Some have onsen onsite or close by, which will make your apres-skiing an even more enjoyable.\n### Don't Miss\n- Staying at a nearby guesthouse and making your stay a multi-day trip\n- Visiting nearby onsen to soothe tired muscles\n- Taking advantage of the lunch tickets most resorts include in their rental prices\n## How to Get There\nGifu's ski resorts are easily acessible by bus or car. Takayama area resorts can be reached by bus or JR train.\nGifu's ski resorts fall into two main groups: those in the south of the prefecture, centered around Gujo, and those in the north around the Takayama and Hida area. The Gujo resorts are all accessible by bus from Nagoya and Gifu (see the websites of each resort for specific details) or by car.\nTakayama can be reached by bus from Matsumoto or by train on the JR Takayama Line from Nagoya Station (2-3 hours) and from Gifu Station (2 hours). From there, buses connect with the resorts (see the websites of each resort for specific details).\n### In the Gujo area\nDue north of Gujo-Hachiman town is a cluster of popular ski and snowboarding destinations, including Dynaland, Hirugano Kogen, Outdoor in Motai, Meiho, Snow Wave Park Shiratori Kogen, Shokawa Kogen, Washigatake, Takasu, White Pia Takasu, and Winghills Shirotori Resort.\n### Dynaland\nLocated about two hours from Nagoya, Dynaland gets incredibly busy on weekends. It boasts 18 separate runs fed by five lifts.\n### Washigatake\nWith 12 runs and five lifts, Washigatake is also well stocked with restaurants and has an onsen onsite.\n### Takasu\nTakasu has 12 separate runs, but it's the snowboarding park that brings the crowds in, with all the rails, pipes and walls you could ask for.\n### Takayama and Hida\nAround the Takayama and Hida area there are two main resort clusters. East of the city, Hounokidaira, Hirayu Onsen and Hida Takayama are popular, particularly for overnight trips, given the wealth of onsen and inns. North of Takayama, Star Spur Ryokufu, Hida Highland, Hida Kawai and Shirakawago Hirase Onsen Shirayumi are always busy on the weekends.\n### Hounokidaira\nWith 16 runs and five lifts, this is the area's main resort. It also features some off-piste areas.\n### Hirayu Onsen\nIt has only three runs, but being a short walk from the bus terminal and the onsen, the inns and hotels of Hirayu Onsen make this ski resort one of the most convenient and least crowded in Gifu.\n### Rentals\nFor the larger or taller skier, it's worth checking on available rental sizes in advance with all resorts, since some only carry boots up to 28 or 29 centimeters and corresponding lengths of skis."}

Once a key crossroads for travelers, it is now a window into a slower and older Japan close enough to major cities for a day trip. There are also 10 ski resorts in the area, and limestone caves to explore. The town is home to a huge and hugely popular Bon Odori dance festival in the Summer.\n### Don't Miss\n- One of Japan's most important traditional dance festivals\n- Making your own plastic food sample at Sample Village Iwasaki\n- Choose from 10 different ski resorts\n## How to Get There\nGujo Hachiman can be reached by train or hourly highway bus from Nagoya.\nTrain: From Gifu Station, take the JR Takayama Line to Mino-Ota Station (about 40 minutes) and change to the local Nagaragawa Railway for Gujo Hachiman. The station is a lengthy but pleasant walk from the town center. From Nagoya, get to Gifu Station first, either on the Tokaido Main Line or on the same JR Takayama Line that continues to Mino-Ota Station.\nBus: Most highway buses from Nagoya and Gifu stop at Gujo Hachiman Inter, and a smaller number stop at the more convenient Gujo Hachiman Jokamachi Plaza.\n### A castle reconstructed in wood, demonstrations of period weaponry\nThe original castle was built in the 16th century atop a hill overlooking the valley, about a 20-minute walk from the town center. Many castles across Japan were destroyed in the 1870s, and Gujo Hachiman was no exception. When it was rebuilt in 1933, however, Gujo Hachiman was reconstructed in wood rather than the concrete used for many other restored castles. It is one of Japan's oldest wooden castle reconstructions.\nGujo Hachiman Castle's location amid maple trees make it one of the most photogenic fortresses in Japan. Volunteers give demonstrations of period weaponry—the small cannons are particularly impressive—and the museum inside the castle tells fascinating tales about the town.\n### A colossal dance festival\nOn 31 nights from July to September, the hills around Gujo Hachiman come alive with the sound of music. Tens of thousands of people descend on Gujo Hachiman for its renowned Gujo Odori Bon Dance Festival.\nWhether you want to dance the night away or just sample some community energy, this event—over 400 years old and based on much older traditions—is recognized as one of the three most important dance festivals in Japan.\n### Make your own fake food samples\nThe food sample displays in the windows of restaurants are ubiquitous in Japan. Gujo Hachiman is a famous manufacturing center of these food replicas. Several of the manufacturers open their doors to visitors and hold workshops where you can make your own sushi, tempura or vegetable samples. Sample Village Iwasaki is the most famous, and reservations are advised.\n### Leaf-peeping\nGujo Hachiman is nestled in a valley surrounded by heavily forested mountains, making it an ideal place to view the fiery autumn leaves. The Momiji Festival runs for a few weeks every November when, despite the chill in the air, people flock to the town. The highlight is the area around the castle, which is lit up at night. The garden at Jionji temple is also gorgeous at this time of year.\n### Spelunking in Otaki's limestone caves\nSouth of the town, this series of caves and caverns includes a 30-meter underground waterfall and some bizarre millennia old stalactites. The 700-meter stretch open to the public takes about 30 minutes to tour.\n### Okumino area ski resorts\nThe Okumino area holds a collection of 10 ski resorts, with direct bus links to Central Japan International Airport. Okumino's convenience, choice of runs, great powder and stunning views draw skiers and snowboarders from across Japan.\n### Sword-ed in Seki\nOnce a center of excellence for samurai sword manufacture, Seki had to shift to manufacturing more common items such as kitchen knives, cutlery and other bladed tools when the Edo period (1603-1867) ended and modernity was ushered in. Today, the tools and other items they produce during the day are prized as souvenirs, and a museum of sword-making with live demonstrations draws in crowds.\nA short walk away the Seki Zenkoji temple–named after its larger, more famous cousin in Nagano City–has a short pilgrimage trail and a pitch-black underground passageway where you can touch the door to the afterlife."}

Ena to the ancient forests and Tsukechi Gorge to the Tokai Nature Path and Lake Nenoue, which make this great trekking territory. Campgrounds are plentiful here as well.\n### Don't Miss\n- Magome, a post town that still feels like 17th-century Japan\n- Hiking along the dramatic Tsukechi Gorge and scaling Mt. Ena\n- Taisho-mura, a glimpse into Japanese life in the 1910s and 1920s\n## How to Get There\nNakatsugawa Station is the area's main transportation hub.\nNakatsugawa is on the JR Chuo Main Line, just under an hour from Nagoya and around two hours from Gifu (change trains in Tajimi). It is within easy reach of Matsumoto Station in Nagano Prefecture.\nFrom there, buses go to all major tourist locations and connect with local towns and villages.\n### Edo life in an old Nakasendo post town\nNakatsugawa was once a post town on the Nakasendo road from Tokyo to Kyoto. Restored Edo period (1603-1867) buildings—including warehouses, sake shops and restaurants—offer a look into Nakatsugawa's past, and the Nakasendo Historical Museum provides context.\nThe grounds around the ruined Naegi Castle and Asahigaoka Park (home to Asahigaoka Shrine and Nanrinji Temple) make for pleasant walks. These days Nakatsugawa is also known as a jumping-off point for exploring other attractions in the area, such as Magome and Taisho-mura, hiking and skiing in the rugged Japan Alps or relaxing in one of the many onsen.\n### Step back centuries at Magome\nAnother old post town on the Nakasendo , Magome, is the highlight of the area. From functioning water wheels to traditional soba restaurants, every aspect of Magome is presented as it would have been in the 17th century.\nConnected to neighboring post town Tsumago by an eight-kilometer path that twists through stunning countryside landscapes. You could easily spend a whole day here taking in the peace and beauty of long-ago Japan.\n### Roaming through the Tsukechi-Kyo Valley\nTsukechi Gorge is a deep gorge in an ancient forest offering great hiking routes and photo opportunities. Consider camping here to enjoy the valley at your own pace and experience the clear, star-strewn skies.\nThe forest is home to the lemon-scented Kiso cypress, a famous and much sought-after wood used in temples and shrines across Japan.\n### These boots were made for walking\nEna is a popular town in the area, with two interesting museums: the Hiroshige Museum of Art, offering woodblock prints from the master and others, and the Hishiya Museum, the restored house of a village headman.\nThe mountains around Ena are another attraction. The Tokai Nature Path leads south through beautiful scenery, including Mt. Ena. The hike up the steep 600-meter trail to the summit is no casual stroll, but the panoramic views from the top are worth the effort.\n### Taisho-mura takes you back a century\nRolling down the scenic Akechi Railroad from Ena, you can open the windows to shoot the scenes outside. The train brings you to Taisho-mura, a village whose buildings date from the Taisho period (1912-1926). The roads leading away from the station are lined with structures from the era.\nYou can learn more about them at Nihon Taisho Mura, a modern museum that re-creates the life of the town in the early 20th century and its then-thriving sericulture industry. You can rent a kimono tailored in the style of the time.\nNear Nihon Taisho Mura is Old Miyake House, a thatched wooden Japanese farmhouse and garden that dates to 1688."}

Norikura\n## How to Get There\nLocated in the center of Japan, Okuhida Onsen can be accessed by public transport from Nagoya, Matsumoto or Takayama.\nFrom Nagoya station, take the Takayama Line to Takayama Station. You can take a one-hour bus from there to Hirayu. From Hirayu, there is a bus line that runs to Fukuji, Shin-Hirayu, Tochi and Shin-Hotaka. Another line runs to Mt. Norikura.\nThe Matusmoto Line bus runs from Matsumoto to Takayama, stopping at Hirayu. There are only a few buses a day so check an up-to-date timetable before traveling.\n### Five hot spring retreats\nOkuhida boasts five picturesque hot spring resorts: Hirayu, Fukuji, Shin-Hirayu, Tochio and Shin-Hotaka. All are conveniently accessible on the same bus route. You can spend the day shuttling between them, sampling baths with different mineral content and competing views.\nAlternatively, stay at one of the hotels or ryokan (traditional inns) and indulge in a multi-course meal of assorted local delicacies.\n### One of the tallest mountains in Japan\nA rugged volcano and among Japan's tallest mountains, Norikura is linked to Hirayu via a road that reaches an elevation of 2,700 meters. The road is closed to public vehicles but buses operate from the Norikura Kogen Tourist Information Center and Hirayu between mid-April and late October.\nThere are many hiking paths around Norikura and the 3,026-meter peak can be reached relatively easily in just 90 minutes from the the 2,700-meter Tatamidaira bus terminal.\n### Over the top in a double decker\nAnother destination in the area is Japan's only double-decker ropeway at Shin-Hotaka, and the ropeway car is as popular with photographers as the views down the mountainside.\nThe sights from the observation deck at the ropeway terminus are spectacular. Reaching 2,150 meters, the ropeway is a convenient way to reach dizzying heights without the effort of a long, difficult hike.\nWith well-signposted trails leading from and around the terminus and a restaurant serving snacks and refreshments, it is easy to spend a leisurely half day in the mountains.\n### Exploring more of the mountains\nTo fully experience the Northern Japan Alps, you can make a day of it, hiking from the ropeway terminus to Nishihotaka Doppyo (2,701 meters) and then down into Kamikochi via the nearby Nishihotakadake Mountain Hut. Be prepared to start early, however, because the total journey takes a full eight hours with few breaks."}

The journey from Nagoya takes about 2 hours 20 minutes, and from Toyama it takes around 1 hour 30 minutes. Highway buses also operate to Takayama from Matsumoto.\n### A festive town\nTakayama is a popular destination year-round but is paticularly busy for the Takayama Festival in spring and autumn.\nOn festival days, the streets throng with visitors and locals who come to watch the festival procession and see the ornate floats. Accommodation can be hard to come by, so booking ahead is essential if you want to be in town to catch either festival.\n### Sanmachi, heart of Takayama\nThe heart of Takayama city, the Sanmachi area of preserved buildings, attracts tourists from all over the country. You could spend a whole day wandering these old streets, buying souvenirs from the many craft shops, sampling local tea and digging into local treats like wagyu sushi.\nA number of sake breweries are also located in and around the Sanmachi district, and tasting is possible.\n### Morning markets\nExplore the two markets, one on the bank of the Miyagawa River and another in front of Takayama Jinya. Every morning, merchants set up their stalls, selling local produce and artisanal craftworks.\n### A smorgasbord for history buffs\nTakayama is a haven for history buffs. Hida Folk Village (Hida-no-Sato) preserves more than 30 historic buildings from the Hida area, including traditional homes with thatched roofs, some steep-angled in the local Gassho-zukuri style.\nTakayama Matsuri Yatai Kaikan displays 4 of the ornately decorated floats that grace the streets during the town-wide festivals. Hida Takayama Town Museum tells the story of Takayama's founding and development, with exhibits on art and writers associated with the town.\n### Peak interest\nHirayu is the western gateway to Kamikochi (Matsumoto performs this role in the east), a hiker's paradise. Private vehicles are not permitted into the park in an effort to protect the natural environment.\nMt. Norikura is another popular hiking destination. To the west of Takayama, Mt. Hakusan is also a favored spot for climbers and nature photographers alike, with stunning waterfalls and lakes around the base of the mountain. Another option is the Shinhotaka Ropeway which takes visitors 2,156 meters above sea level, for views from above the clouds.\n### Thatched village bliss\nFifty minutes by bus north of Takayama is Shirakawa-go, a UNESCO World Heritage site where visitors can wander around verdant gardens and carp-filled ponds. Many of the traditional gassho-zukuri houses are open to the public, and a few function as inns.\n### Hida Furukawa\nHida Furukawa is something of a sibling to Takayama. Downriver and containing many of the same style of restored buildings, it can make for a peaceful escape from its more popular neighbor.\nThirty minutes northeast of Hida Furukawa stands Kamioka Castle. The current structure dates back to 1970 but the original was built on the same site in 1564. Some of the original walls and foundations remain and the castle is now a museum of weapons and armor.\n### Gero Onsen\nAn hour south of Takayama, or two hours north of Nagoya, Gero Onsen is a renowned hot spring resort. Charlie Chaplin visited and his statue stands to commemorate the event. There are three public baths, and the private ones attached to hotels and ryokan are open to the public at certain times of the day.\nIf you crave more than just relaxation, you can stroll the resort, visiting sights such as Onsenji Temple and Gassho Village, a small-scale version of the Hida Folk Village."}

From one of these two points, take a train to Uenoshi Station in downtown Iga.\nThe journey from Osaka, Kyoto or Nagoya takes between 90 minutes and two hours in total.\n### Where ninja once roamed\nThis quiet, inland area of Mie Prefecture, with its small towns and farmland nestled in the mountains, is also historically home to Japan's famous ninja. It was here that the Iga-ryu school developed its mysterious martial art. The ninjas maintained their base in the Iga area for centuries, venturing across the country to act as spies and assassins for samurai warlords.\nThose days are long past, but ninjutsu's stealthy arts are alive and well. If you want to delve into the ways of the ninja, then come and explore the remote forests in western Mie they called home.\nIga City makes a good starting point for learning about the shadow warriors and their history. The Ninja Museum of Igaryu has a maze-like ninja house open for exploration. You can also see ninjutsu masters demonstrate their techniques and test your own warrior aptitude by throwing some razor-sharp ninja weapons.\nAfter the museum, head next door to Iga Ueno Castle from which feudal lords once ruled the area and commanded the local ninja. Rent a ninja costume and spice up your photos by posing in stealth mode.\nContinue your adventure in the secluded mountains to the south where you'll find the Akame 48 Waterfalls. There you can join a ninja training course held on the same terrain where ninja once practiced their arts.\nWhen you're finished, hike out to view some of Akame's fabulous waterfalls while keeping your eyes open for the rare Japanese giant salamander along the river. If you miss one there, you can see one for sure at the Japanese Salamander Center not far from the entrance to the falls.\n### Perfect relaxation for a newbie warrior\nYunoyama Onsen is a hot spring resort where you can unwind with a soothing bath whether you're staying at one of the inns there or just stopping by. A ropeway will take you to the summit of Mt. Gozaisho, where skiing, hiking trails, and panoramic views await."}

Beyond exploring the religious facets of this region, you'll have ample chances to wander historical districts, lounge on sandy beaches, and indulge in local delicacies such as spiny lobster and abalone.\n### Don't Miss\n- The mystical atmosphere of Ise-Jingu\n- Shaved ice from a shop along Oharaimachi-street outside Naiku\n- Lounging on the beach in Toba\n## How to Get There\nThe Ise Bay area is easily reached by Kintetsu Railway from Osaka and Nagoya.\nThe city of Ise is the most common starting point for travel in the area. Ise-shi Station is approximately 1 hour 45 minutes from Osaka, 2 hours from Kyoto and 1.5 hours from Nagoya by Kintetsu limited express. From Nagoya the journey is about 90 minutes.\n### The soul of Japan\nShinto is the Japanese indigenous religion, and Ise-Jingu is composed of 125 shrines including main sanctuaries Naiku and Geku. Naiku is its most sacred site, where Amaterasu Omikami, the deity likened to the sun, is enshrined. You could visit Ise-Jingu and surrounding area as a daytrip but staying overnight will allow you to explore at a more leisurely pace.\n### Geku and Sengukan Museum\nWhile Naiku of Ise-Jingu is its most famous area, Geku and Sengukan Museum about 5 kilometers away are also worth visiting. Both are in central Ise, about a 10-minute walk from Iseshi Station. The architecture of Geku is similar to Naiku, though there are some differences between them.\nThe Sengukan Museum reveals Ise-Jingu's Shikinen Sengu (shrine reclocation) ritual through a variety of exhibits. These include a full sized reconstruction of the structure in which a deity is enshrined, and displays of the instructions to create sacred adornments and treasures for the deities.\n### Naiku\nNaiku is dedicated to the deity Amaterasu Omikami, likened to the sun and mythical ancestor of Japan's successive emperors. It's also said to house a sacred mirror, Yata-no-kagami, a symbol of the deity, which is part of the Imperial regalia.\nOharaimachi-street, outside of Naiku is a long, meandering, old-fashioned street lined with shops and restaurants which is well worth taking time to explore.\nTo enter the precincts of Naiku, cross the wooden Ujibashi Bridge, passing through the torii gates on either side.\nWhile there are many interesting affiliated shrines and other Shinto structures throughout the grounds, the main building of Naiku is largely obscured from public view. However, the solemn atmosphere makes a stroll through the lush natural surroundings an amazing experience.\n### Shopping and dining options\nAfter visiting Ise-Jingu, wander the nearby street of Oharaimachi and Okage Yokocho Square to sample culinary offerings like Ise's uber-thick udon noodles and shaved ice. If you're a green tea aficionado, Ise is famous for its tea, so be sure to have a cup. The area is a good place to pick out special gifts for friends and family back home.\n### Beyond Ise\nWhile Ise is the area's main draw, Matsusaka and Tsu both make for worthwhile visits as well.\nMatsusaka was once a thriving merchant town with a castle that towered over the area, and the walls of the castle remain for sightseers to explore. The city's modern-day claim to fame is the heavily marbled Matsusaka beef that rivals, and some say outdoes, the more well-known Kobe variety. They even make sushi with it. Matsusaka's yakitori, topped with miso, has also gained a stellar reputation among foodies.\nTsu is a great base for excursions to other parts of Mie Prefecture. While in town, don't miss the Mie Prefectural Art Museum that features Western-style art produced by Japanese artists.\nFor sun worshippers and ocean lovers, there are numerous beaches along Ise Bay, particularly in Toba, east of Ise City."}

Buses also service the area, and take about four hours from the Meitetsu Bus Center in Nagoya.\nA combination of trains and buses from Kyoto or Osaka takes roughly 5 hours. The Magose Pass on the old Kumano Kaido Pilgrimage Trail is even farther south, between Aiga and Owase Stations on the Kisei Main Line.\nAs with other parts of rural Japan, a rental car will greatly enhance your ability to explore.\n### Hit the beach\nThe city of Kumano rewards travelers to this distant part of Mie Prefecture with several fun and interesting sights and activities. Head down to the southeastern part of town and you'll find Shichiri Mihama Beach. Spanning 22 kilometers, it is the longest sand and gravel beach in Japan. From here you can see the unusual beak-shaped Onigajo rock formation off to the northeast.\nHead the opposite direction along the beach to reach Hananoiwaya-jinja Shrine, which locals report to be the oldest in the nation. At the shrine, try making a wish on a sacred rock, and if your timing's right, witness the rope renewal ritual that happens every February and October.\n### Fireworks by the sea\nAnother big local event is the Kumano Fireworks Festival held annually on August 17. This is your chance to see a dazzling and creative display as fireworks are launched into the air from boats stationed out at sea. The Onigajo rocks even have a part to play in the show. Stop by and see why.\n### A rest stop for weary pilgrims\nThe hike over Magose Pass is a good place to sample the ancient Kumano Kodo Pilgrimage Trail. Used for centuries to access the sacred sites throughout the area, today it's part of UNESCO's World Heritage sites and Pilgrimage Routes in the Kii Mountain Range. Many consider the five-kilometer hike over the pass one of the most picturesque along the whole trail.\nIf you have extensive hiking planned along the Kumano Kodo, Kumano stands a good chance of being near the beginning or end of your journey. Be sure to take time to appreciate the view of the coast from atop Mt. Tengura, accessible via a path from Magose Pass."}

Inatori Onsen, known for its kinmedai snapper and tsurushi hina dolls, and Atagawa Onsen, which was discovered by samurai Ota Doukan in the 15th century, and has soothed numerous bathers since then. Fishing ports in the area offer some of the freshest seafood in Japan.\n### From black ships to white sands\nShimoda, a port town located at the southern tip of the Izu Peninsula, is the historic place where the black ships led by Commodore Matthew Perry landed, beginning trade wiht the United States after a long period of isolation. Ryosenji temple, where the treaty was signed, is located at the end of Perry Road, a pleasant stroll through the city.\nAlthough Shimoda has an interesting history, it is also popular for its many beaches, such as Shirahama Ohama Beach, which offers some of the best surfing, sand and water sports in Japan. There are also seaside pensions, hotels, and inns all over Shimoda, some with hot springs.\n### Rugged coastlines\nThe southern tip of the Izu Peninsula, as represented by Cape Irozaki, offers rugged seascapes of undulating coastlines and sheer cliffs. The lighthouse here offers excellent views, and you can board a boat that runs around the cape.\n### Heading inland to the highlands and forests\nInland, Izu's natural landscapes are charming as well, such as the lush, green Izu Highlands and the Inland Izu also has its charms, such as the verdant Izu Highlands and Mt Omuro, a distinctly bowl-shaped extinct volcano. Mt. Amagi, Izu's highest vantage point, is actually a series of peaks worth a climb, including Mt. Banjiro and Mt. Banzaburo. This area also has a beautiful waterfall called Joren-no-Taki, with wasabi fields, trout fishing and Shuzenji Onsen.\nWhile you're here, visit one of the many gardens, historical museums, or art galleries featuring the works of Renoir and Picasso.\n### Intriguing islets, Japan's deepest bay, and a cape with a golden glow\nThe zigzagging coastline of Nishi-Izu is one of Japan's most fascinating landforms. The Dogashima Coast from Sebama to Cape Ajo is dotted with oddly shaped rocks and islets such as Sanshirojima and Zojima.\nDogashima Onsen, a seaside hot spring resort with plenty of enticing inns and hotels, has two phenomena nearby worth seeing. One is known as Tombolo—you can walk from the mainland to Sanshiro Island at low tide. The other is a sea cave with a natural skylight that's both serene and mysterious.\nFurther north along the coast is Toi, with a gold mine, fine beaches and onsen of its own. The west coast of Izu faces Suruga Bay, one of the country's greatest treasure troves of seafood. Try some of the fabled sakura ebi, or cherry blossom shrimp, a very local delicacy.\n### To the symbol of Japan, Mt. Fuji\nIzu is a popular day trip destination from Tokyo, but it takes at least a few days to fully enjoy it. If you are staying near Atami, why not take a trip to Japan's most iconic mountain, Mt. Fuji, can be seen from the Izu Peninsula. But nothing compares to seeing it up close."}

Fuji (Shizuoka)\n## Discover great lakes, resorts, onsen and outdoor recreational possibilities around Japan's most fabled peak\nVisible from hundreds of kilometers away yet only a short bullet train ride from Tokyo, Mt. Fuji draws visitors from the world over who come to see and sometimes climb the famous peak. What many travelers don't know is that there are other natural attractions, fantastic recreational possibilities, historic sites and shopping options around the base of this iconic mountain.\nTo the north, for example, the Fuji Five Lakes are a regular destination for outdoor enthusiasts, particularly people into trekking and water sports. The vast Asagiri Highland region to the west offers similar options. And onsen are scattered throughout the area, many with magnificent views of the mountain.\nFor something completely different, head to nearby Gotemba, site of Japan's biggest premium outlet shopping mall.\n### Don't Miss\n- Shiraito Falls—one of the most scenic and unusual waterfalls in Japan\n- Soaking in an onsen with a view of Japan's iconic peak\n- Izu Shaboten Zoo, a quirky mix of zoo and cactus preserve\n- The Asagiri Highland area for outdoor pursuits\n## How to Get There\nMt. Fuji and its environs are reachable by bus, train, car and air.\nTrains from major stations along the Tokaido Shinkansen route—including Tokyo, Nagoya and Osaka—run to Shizuoka and Shin-Fuji stations, and slower trains go to Fuji, Fujinomiya and Gotemba stations.\nMany highway buses connect Tokyo and Shizuoka as well as individual sightseeing spots around Mt. Fuji. Buses operate between Shin-Fuji, Fujinomiya and the Fuji Five Lakes stations, stopping at sights such as Shiraito Falls along the way. Mt. Fuji Shizuoka Airport, handles flights from Sapporo, Okinawa, Fukuoka and Kagoshima, as well as international destinations such as Seoul, Taipei and a few major cities in China.\n### Quick Facts\nMany people scale Mt. Fuji at night to see the sunrise, known as goraiko\nMt. Fuji's original crater is known as Yukyu, or \"Shrine of the Depths\"\nFujisan Hongu Sengen Taisha was built to appease an angry Mt. Fuji\nThe nearby Gotemba Premium Outlets is Japan's largest shopping complex\n### Staying cool at the Fuji Five Lakes, and other amusements\nPeople head for the Mt. Fuji area in droves throughout the year, but the traffic is especially high in summer as urbanites escape the city heat and humidity. The Fuji Five Lakes arrayed around the northern side of the mountain— Kawaguchiko, Saiko, Yamanakako, Shojiko and Motosuko—are prime water sport, cycling and hiking destinations. You'll find onsen, amusement parks like Fuji-Q Highland and the most-trafficked trail up Mt. Fuji on the Yamanashi side as well.\n### Nature all year here\nWith cherry blossoms and azaleas in the spring, lavender and hydrangeas in the summer, colored leaves in the fall and snowfall in the winter, the mountain's skirts are constantly changing color. No matter when you're visiting, the Mt. Fuji area will be showcasing some of Japan's beautiful scenery.\n### Culture ancient and modern\nThe venerable Kitaguchihongu Fuji Sengen shrines associated with Mt. Fuji draw a constant stream of visitors, and are a traditional starting point for climbing the mountain. A 10-minute walk from Fujinomiya Station, Fujisan Hongu Sengen Taisha's origins date back to BCE, although the current structures were built in the 17th century.\nLocated east of the mountain, Fuji Speedway, presents a modern contrast. Site of many major auto-racing events, the speedway can be reached via bus from Gotemba Station.\nThe Gotemba Premium Outlets, one of Japan's flagship shopping discount malls and boasting over 200 stores, is a more recent attraction in the area.\n### Southern charms and summer outdoor fun\nOn the Shizuoka side of Mt. Fuji, you can explore natural phenomena such as Shiraito Falls and Asagiri Highland. Shiraito Falls is one of the area's most mesmerizing attractions, formed from Mt. Fuji snowmelt and named for its cascading “silken thread” waters that fall from a 20-meter-high cliff spanning 150 meters.\nAsagiri Highland—Asagiri means “morning mist”—is a popular summer resort with broad meadows, dairy farms, camping sites, golf courses and paragliding schools. Lake Tanuki here is a good spot for cycling, camping and fishing.\n### Animals on parade, and cacti\nSituated just south of Mt. Fuji, Fuji Safari Park is a popular zoo where the animals roam free in environments that approximate their natural habitat. You can observe the creatures—including lions, tigers, bears, giraffes, cheetahs, elephants, rhinoceroses, zebras and bison—from private vehicles or special buses, and on a nature trail.\nIzu Shaboten Zoo is another fun possibility—an odd combination of a zoo and a cactus garden—that's especially good if you're traveling with kids, since many of the animals can be touched and even held.\n### Making Shizuoka tourism greener\nYou've got more green tourism options thanks to an initiative called Fuji-no-Kuni, meaning “Mt. Fuji Country.” Shizuoka Prefecture has over 50 locations where you can try your hand at various arts and crafts, participate in outdoor excursions and experience a traditional Japanese inn or restaurant."}

It's also where Tokugawa Ieyasu—the shogun who reunified Japan in 1600—grew up and lived out his final years. Many reminders of his presence remain, including Sunpu Castle Park.\nThe city's environs include Miho-no-Matsubara Pine Grove, a seaside pine grove with views of Mt. Fuji noted by poets and artists, and Nihondaira Plateau, which overlooks the Pacific and tea farms. Shizuoka also has beautiful shrines connected to the Tokugawa clan−Shizuoka Sengen and Kunozan Toshogu Shrine. The latter is where Tokugawa Ieyasu rests.\nIf you're into shopping, dining and nightlife, head for the city's extensive shopping complexes. One of them, S-Pulse Dream Plaza, has a theme park and a museum dedicated to sushi.\n### Don't Miss\n- Nihondaira Plateau's rolling hills, offering spectacular views, as well as home to Kunozan Toshogu Shrine\n- The well-preserved Mariko and Utsunoya post stations on the old Tokaido route\n- Miho-no-Matsubara Pine Grove, an extensive area along a beach with a stunning view of Mt.

Various dishes and snacks incorporate tea, including soba, gelato, and waffles filled with matcha cream.\nThere are teahouses all over the city, and the experience of leisurely imbibing tea is a quintessentially Japanese joy. The tea itself comes in a multitude of variations, so be sure to sample as many as possible to find your preferred brew. If you'd like to pick your own tea, May is the best time.\n### Shogun territory\nSumpu Castle in Shizuoka is where the man who united Japan and went on to found a feudal family dynasty that lasted nearly three centuries—shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu—spent both his formative and final years. Sumpu Park, located within the castle walls, features an Ieyasu-inspired Shizuoka Festival complete with cherry blossom dances during the first weekend in April.\nShizuoka Sengen Shrine, west of Sumpu Park, is the collective name for a group of three shrines, the Kambe Shrine, Asama Shrine, and Ohtoshimioya Shrine, all lacquered a rich red. The shrine grounds also have a massive pond.\nMany items associated with the Tokugawa clan and Ieyasu, including a suit of his armor, are housed in the Shizuoka Museum of Cultural Assets on the grounds here.\n### When a plateau is not a plateau\nNihondaira Plateau was at one time flat enough to be called as such, but nature had other plans and pushed the land up into hills. Be glad it did, because the vistas of tea plants, the Pacific and nearby Mt. Fuji are more spectacular as a result.\nNearby, via ropeway, is Kunozan Toshogu Shrine, the magnificent shrine where Tokugawa Ieyasu is buried. It was built in the Gongen-zukuri style reminiscent of Nikko, in which a stone-paved room connects the main hall and worship hall.\n### A scene painted and praised by artists and poets\nThere's a stretch of coastline known as Miho-no-Matsubara Pine Grove near the city that has been celebrated in pictures and poems for centuries. One look and you'll see why—this pine grove runs alongside the sea and offers an unforgettable view of Mt. Fuji. The area is on the UNESCO World Heritage list as part of Japan's Mt. Fuji cultural site.\n### More treats in store\nBesides the fresh and delectable seafood taken from Suruga Bay and the seas surrounding it, Shizuoka is famous for its other produce, including strawberries, sweet mikan oranges, vegetables, and wasabi—the spicy condiment that accompanies many Japanese dishes, including sushi.\nProbably the most unusual fare here is the sakura ebi or cherry shrimp, the sweet and succulent little crustaceans that are primarily found in Suruga Bay. Be sure to try some while you're in Shizuoka."}

You can also access Minobu by bus from Shinjuku Expressway Bus Terminal in around three and a half hours.\n### Climb a staircase into the sky at Minobusan Kuonji Temple\nKuon-ji Temple and its surroundings are a magical escape from the bustle of modern Japanese cities. Minobusan Kuonji's temple gate is one of the largest in Japan, and access to the main temple is by a steep stone staircase.\n### Akasawa village lost in time deep in the mountains of Yamanashi\nIt takes time and effort to get to Akasawa, but once there, you will be rewarded with spectacular mountain vistas. Although there used to be over a dozen inns that served pilgrims who walked from Minobusan Kuonji Temple to Keishin Temple, only one is open today.\nHowever, the other inns are lovingly maintained to give this picturesque village its charm. Expect to hear the call of deer as the sun goes down.\n### Book a room at the oldest hotel in the world\nIf you choose to stay a night at Nishiyama Onsen Keiunkan, you will have access to hot spring baths that have soothed the aches and pains of the who's who of Japan's illustrious elite—from Empresses to military commanders.\nTake the opportunity to relax in the very place where Japan's most powerful historical figures sought refuge.\n### The Mt. Minobu to Mt. Shichimen pilgrimage\nFollowing an ancient pilgrimage route, start your hike at the base of Mt. Minobu by walking through the large sanmon gate and climbing the steep 287-step staircase to Minobusan Kuonji Temple. The ascent of Mt. Minobu, which really begins behind the main temple at Kuon-ji, is punctuated by ancient graveyards, temples, and shrines.\n### The ancient village\nAfter you have reached the summit of the mountain and visited the mountain-top temple, descend to the ancient village of Akasawa.\n### Mt. Fuji views at Mt. Shichimen\nThe village, with its inns, green tea fields and dramatic mountain vistas, is an unforgettable delight. Before you ascend Mt. Shichimen, shower under one of the dramatic waterfalls near the entrance to the mountain. Be sure to see the sunrise over Mt. Fuji from the temple gate at the summit of Mt. Shichimen."}

Fuji (Yamanashi)", "category": "destination", "text": "# YAMANASHIMt. Fuji (Yamanashi)Experience the ancient pilgrimage to the summit of Mt. Fuji\n- Mt. Fuji (Yamanashi)\n## Experience the ancient pilgrimage to the summit of Mt. Fuji\nDuring the Edo period (1603-1867), followers of the Fuijiko faith would embark on a pilgrimage from Edo (modern-day Tokyo) to the top of Mt. Fuji on foot. The trail is still very popular today.\n### Don't Miss\n- Stay overnight on Mt. Fuji and then climb to the top to see the sunrise\n- Reserve proper trekking gear from La Mont, which has a shop in Kawaguchiko, to be delivered to you at the Yoshida Trail 5th Stations\n- During the climbing season at night, look at the northeast side of Mt. Fuji and you will see thousands of climbers' lights twinkling like a glow worm\n## How to Get There\nMt. Fuji is located in southeastern Yamanashi near the border of Shizuoka, accessible by JR train or bus from Shinjuku Station.\nTake an express train on the JR Chuo Line, and change at Otsuki Station for the privately-run Fuji Kyuko Line (JR Rail Pass not accepted). Alternatively, you can take a bus to Kawaguchiko Station from Shin-Fuji Station (2 hours and 15 minutes) or Mishima Station (1.5 hours), which are both on the JR Tokaido Shinkansen Line.\nMt. Fuji Station (Fujisan Station) is the closest station to the Yoshida Trail. Once you arrive at either Mt. Fuji Station (Fujisan Station) or Kawaguchiko Station, you can get a bus to Mt. Fuji 5th Station. You can also get to Mt. Fuji 5th Station via bus from Shinjuku Expressway Bus Terminal in just under 2.5 hours. The bus journey to Kawaguchiko Station takes almost 2 hours.\n### Kitaguchi Hongu Fuji Sengen-jinja Shrine\nThe historic entrance to Mt. Fuji, located at Kitaguchi Hongu Fuji Sengen-jinja Shrine, is a must see for those who plan to climb the sacred volcano. Proceed slowly along the approach to the shrine in order to study the moss-covered stone lanterns lining your way. The enormous gate (Fujisan Ootorii) marks your departure from this world and your arrival in the world of the sacred.\n### Thousand-year-old trees surrounding the shrine\nPay particular attention to the massive Japanese cedars that surround the shrine. These thousand-year-old trees stand as a testament to the ancient practice of venerating Mt. Fuji. Taro is the name of the tree at the front of the shrine, while Jiro, his twin, can be seen at the back.\n### The Yoshida Trail\nAlthough it is still possible to walk directly from the back of Kitaguchi Hongu Fuji Sengen-jinja Shrine to the top of Mt. Fuji, the path between the shrine and Umagaeshi, the entrance to the Yoshida Trail, has been lost to time. It is still possible to start the ascent of Mt. Fuji from the shrine, but a GPS feature on your smartphone will be indispensable to ensure you stay on course.\n### Bus to Umagaeshi during climbing season\nOnce you arrive at the entrance to Umagaeshi, you will be greeted by a pair of stone monkeys guarding the gate. Enter here to climb to Mt. Fuji 5th Station in virtual undisturbed silence. For the less intrepid climber, there is a bus that departs Mt. Fuji Station (Fujisan Station) for Umagaeshi during the climbing season (July and August).\nExperienced climbers ascending Mt. Fuji outside the official climbing season (July 1 to September 10) do so at their own risk\n### Mt. Fuji's 5th Station\nAs your peaceful ascent to Mt. Fuji's 5th station draws to a close, savor the last moments just before you encounter the dozens of expressway buses that have arrived via the Fuji Subaru Line. Now you can resupply for the most challenging part of the climb. Remember that you will be ascending beyond the tree line, so it's going to get much cooler, especially at night. You will be able to access many services at the 5th station, so be sure to have a look around before you continue your ascent of Mt. Fuji.\n### Make sure you're prepared\nTake this opportunity to send a postcard or ask any final questions of the tourist information staff. Be sure to have warm clothing, rain gear, and a good pair of hiking boots as Mt. Fuji can become a very inhospitable place in a sudden downpour.\n### The Yoshida Fire Festival\nEach year, on the night of August 26, the Chinka Taisai is held to prevent Mt. Fuji from erupting. This 400-year-old festival is also known as the mountain's closing festival. At the festival, three-meter-high bonfires are lit along the national road leading to the base of Mt. Fuji. These fires are an offering to Mt. Fuji, the God of Fire. This festival is one of Japan's greatest.\n### Fujisan World Heritage Center\nThe exhibits tell the story of how Mt. Fuji became both a sacred place of worship and an artistic inspiration to the Japanese people. Pay particular attention to the the small dioramas that depict the ascent of Mt. Fuji in ancient times. The center offers multilingual audio guidance in English, Chinese, Korean, Thai and Indonesian. You can also get tourist information about Mt. Fuji and the surrounding area."}

Believers say that if you place a white stone in one of these holes and make a wish, it may come true.\n### On the Ise route\nHananoiwaya is also notable for being one of the oldest shrines in Japan, although the exact date of its foundation remains unknown.\nIf you are traversing the Ise route among the sacred sites and pilgrimage routes in the Kii mountain range, this shrine will be a highlight on your itinerary.\n### When to go\nThe semiannual rope-changing ritual occurs during festivals on February 2 and October 2. After a dance to honor the gods, a rope extending for 170 meters is hung between a sacred pine tree and the rock.\n## Keywords"}

Buses from the station run frequently and take six minutes each way.\nIsuzugawa Station is accessible from nearby major cities on the Kintetsu Line: from Nagoya in about 90 minutes, from Osaka-Namba in around 1 hour 50 minutes, and from Kyoto in approximately 2 hours 30 minutes.\n### The importance of Ise-Jingu\nNaiku is the most important building within the Ise-Jingu Shrine complex. Modern research dates Naiku back to the 4th century, and some structures may have been erected as much as a century earlier.\nThe significance of Naiku stems from its enshrinement of Amaterasu Omikami and its connection with the mythical origin of the Japan. As the deity likened to the sun, she is the supreme deity of Shinto.\nJapan's emperors, including the current successor to the Chrysanthemum Throne, are her direct descendants. The sacred priestess of Ise-Jingu must be related to the imperial household, and the Emperor himself visits Ise-Jingu on special occasions for the matter of great importance of Imperial Household and the nation.\nA Sacred Mirror, Yata-no-kagami, one of the Three Imperial Regalias which are indispensable for the succession to the Imperial Throne is enshrined as a symbol of Amaterasu Omikami within the main sanctuary building of Naiku. According to Shinto myth, this mirror was said to have been used to lure Amaterasu out of a cave where she had been hiding from her younger brother's offensive behavior.\n### When to go\nNaiku is popular year-round, but the New Year's holiday is particularly busy. Many people in Japan visit Shinto shrines to pray for good luck in the new year.\nIn fact, many Japanese try to make the pilgrimage to Ise at least once in their lives, and New Year is considered an especially auspicious time to visit.\nIf you're able to visit in April or late in September, you can see the Kagura Festival featuring performances of ancient Japanese dance and music dedicated to Amaterasu Omikami.\n### A portal to the realm of the spirit\nTo enter the grounds of Naiku, you cross the wooden Ujibashi Bridge. From here you seem to step back in time, with the only sign of modernity being a nearby Japanese flag. The grounds have a solemn, otherworldly atmosphere.\nTraditional torii gates stand at either end of Ujibashi Bridge, acting as a boundary between the secular world and the divine. Visitors should not walk down the middle.\n### Cycle of renewal\nNaiku, the Ujibashi Bridge, and other important structures have been ritually reconstructed once every 20 years since the 7th century. However, the reconstruction was temporarily suspended during the medieval age (15th ～16th century). The most recent renewal was in 2013. Each cycle of reconstruction takes eight years to complete.\n### Modest, yet imposing\nThe structures here are built with unvarnished Japanese cypress traditionally harvested from the Kisodani Area in Nagano Prefecture. In recent years, about 20% of the total lumbers have come from mountains surrounding Naiku.\nIn contrast with the brilliant vermillion red you see at other renowned Shinto shrines like Fushimi Inari Taisha in Kyoto, Naiku is simple and not at all flashy.\nAs you near the main building of Naiku, the view is obscured by a hanging curtain, as regular people should not gaze directly at it.\n### The return journey\nAfter paying your respects, a vast array of food, trinkets, craftwork and more awaits you in the traditional pilgrim's district near Naiku, home to the atmospheric street known as Oharaimachi and the square called Okage Yokocho.\nOther areas of interest near Ise-Jingu include the Hinjitsukan, an elite historic inn that's been converted into a museum. Head south to the city of Toba, and you'll find the Toba Aquarium.\n## Keywords"}

Gozaisho御在所岳\nKomoro-shi, Mie-ken\n## Ski, trek, and take in the view at Mt. Gozaisho, and visit the onsen at its foot\nRide a ropeway up 1,212-meter Mt. Gozaisho to reach Nagoya's closest ski resort and a host of other fun mountaintop activities.\n### Quick Facts\nMt. Gozaisho is known for its unusual rock formations\nThe closest ski slopes to Nagoya are here\n## How to Get There\nYou can reach the mountain through a combination of train, bus, walking and a ropeway ride.\nMt. Gozaisho is located on the border between Komono in Mie Prefecture and Higashi-Omi in Shiga Prefecture, in the center of Suzuka Quasi-National Park.\nFrom Nagoya, take the Kintetsu-Nagoya Limited Express to Kintetsu Yokkaichi Station. Transfer to the local train and get off at Kintetsu Yunoyama Onsen Station. Once here, take the Mie Kotsu Bus to Sanko Yunoyama Onsen. Walk 10 minutes to the ropeway. The journey takes about one hour and 20 minutes.\n### Gozaisho Ropeway\nTo get to the summit of Mt. Gozaisho from the hot springs at Yunoyama Onsen below it, you must take the Gozaisho Ropeway. The gondolas offer amazing views of the cities of Yokkaichi and Ise Bay as well as the Suzuka Mountain Range.\n### Ski in winter, hike in summer\nAfter your ropeway ascent, you'll be at the summit and a quaint ski resort. There are also numerous hiking trails in this area with fantastic views of the surrounding mountains.\n### Mountaintop activities\nThe area that stretches beneath the ropeway, known as Summit Park, has a lot to offer visitors. It includes paved walkways for easy hiking, Gozaisho Nature School with exhibits on the local flora and fauna, and three observatories from which to take in the view.\nThere is also a gift shop and a restaurant that serves the local specialty, Gozaisho curry udon.\n### See unusual rocks\nSome interesting rock formations can be found on the side of Mt. Gozaisho and are viewable from the gondola. One of the most intriguing is a square stone precariously balanced on two supporting pillars. The Japanese believe this formation resembles Jizo, the Buddhist guardian deity of children.\n## Keywords"}

Spring brings cherry blossoms, and autumn a dazzling array of colors. Summer is a verdant, if humid, paradise. Winter requires more care along the path, but you may be rewarded with frozen waterfalls if the weather is sufficiently cold.\n### Hidden natural wonders\nThe remote and forested Akame Valley was a training ground for the Iga-ryu ninja between the 15th and 18th centuries. There are numerous waterfalls along a four-kilometer stretch of the valley accessible via a walkway along the river that provides up-close views. The waters pour into a gorge at the bottom of the valley at Muro-Akame-Aoyama Quasi-National Park.\nThe name Akame, meaning “red eyes,” derives from a mythological encounter at the falls between En-no-gyoja, the founder of Japanese mountain asceticism, and Fudo-myo, a fierce esoteric Buddhist deity. There aren't actually 48 falls; the number likely comes from the traditional number of vows taken by beings in the Buddhist pantheon known as bodhisattvas.\nIt takes three to four hours at a leisurely pace to fully take in the falls. There are restrooms and teahouses along the route. You'll also occasionally encounter stairs along the way; keep in mind that steel steps may be slippery when wet.\nAlso along the route is a campground with a barbecue area.\n### Akame's top five\nFive of Akame's waterfalls are particularly spectacular: Fudo, Senju, Nunobiki, Ninai, and Biwa Falls.\nFudo Falls, named after Akame's Fudo-myo, features a bridge that spans the seven-meter wide cascade.\nSenju is named for how the splashing water resembles the \"thousand arms\" of the merciful Buddhist deity Kannon.\nNunobiki is the highest waterfall at 30 meters, and over the millennia its force has eroded the stone below to form a pool 30 meters deep.\nNinai Falls is popular for its gorgeous view, and Biwa Falls is said to resemble a giant bathtub.\n### Take your time on your way in\nAt the entrance to the area, a ninja training school offers a course on the nearby mountain slopes for adults and children ages 4 and up. The program includes ninja costume rental, with a choice of colors ranging from traditional black to no-way-they-won't-see-you pink. The training lasts about 90 minutes and includes ninja star throwing, wall scaling, and rope traversing.\nIf you're really feeling the stealthy spirit, you can also rent a ninja outfit to wear before setting out on your journey to the falls.\nThe nearby Japanese Salamander Center is a cozy little educational curiosity offering up-close looks at the Japanese giant salamander. It's the second-largest salamander species in the world, measuring up to 1.5 meters. Nowadays, the amphibian is considered near-threatened.\nStill, keep an eye open near the riverbank during your hike. People still spot them in the wild from time to time, though this is less likely if you've opted for the pink ninja costume.\n## Keywords"}

Your travel time about an hour.\n### Quick Facts\nThe Meiji period is characterized by a strong western influence\nHours of operation vary depending on events and the season\n### Walking through history\nMeiji Mura, or Meiji Village, is a stunning demonstration of Meiji period-architecture from Japan and other countries. Walking around this vast theme park museum, see how Western culture inspired the architects of Japan as it moved from its samurai past to its modernized future.\nMost of the buildings constructed during the Meiji period were torn down for city redevelopment or destroyed during the war. This means you are unlikely to see anywhere else the likes of these preserved cultural assets relocated from Japan and abroad, such as Sapporo's telephone exchange, Tokyo's Imperial Hotel (designed by famed architect Frank Lloyd Wright), and Kyoto's Francis Xavier's Cathedral.\n### Historically good food and entertainment\nSome of the historical buildings were repurposed as cafes and candy shops, many selling tasty versions of traditional Meiji period dishes such as curry and rice and croquettes.\nIt takes at least half a day to truly enjoy the entire museum, so take the steam train or streetcar (both require additional fees) to make the most of your visit.\nThe latest information may differ, so please check the official website\n## Keywords"}

It was given back to the original owners in 1895 on the condition that they repair the damage from an earthquake that had struck in 1891 and maintain it from then on.\n### Don't Miss\n- The area's scenery in fall and spring\n- Exploring the original keep and viewing the surrounding land\n## How to Get There\nGet to the Inuyama area by going first to Meitetsu Nagoya Station, then take the Meitetsu Line to Inuyama or Inuyama-yuen stations.\nTo get to Nagoya by Tokaido Shinkansen: Nagoya is 52 minutes from Osaka, and 1 hour and 40 minutes from Tokyo Station. You can also use long-distance bus services between Inuyama Station and Tokyo (Shinjuku), Kyoto, Osaka, Nagoya (every 30 minutes), Gujo Hachiman (1 hour), and Kobe.\n### Quick Facts\nInuyama Castle is one of only 12 original Japanese castles remaining\nThe present keep is a National Treasure\n### A castle for the seasons\nInuyama Castle is at its most delightful in the spring and fall. Sitting on top of a small hill with commanding views of the Kisogawa Valley below and Gifu Prefecture beyond, the skyline is filled with the beautiful bursts of pink from cherry blossoms in April and the deep red and flame orange and yellow of maple leaves in late November. These are particularly busy times around the castle, but the picturesque sights make it worth it.\n### A taste of samurai life\nAs this is a castle of such historical importance, take the time to look around inside the keep. From the steep wooden stairs to the exhibits of samurai armor, folding screens, and swords, you can get a sense of how the castle may have felt for those living within its huge stone walls.\nThe top floor of the castle is an observation platform that gives you fantastic panoramic views of the wide river, the old city, and the rolling hills on all sides.\n### A whole lot of love\nThroughout the castle grounds, you can find small shrines, temples and hidden vantage points. At the foot of the hill on which Inuyama Castle sits, you will find the Sanko Inari Shrine, a place of worship with a short tunnel of red torii gates. The shrine is famed as a place for those who have been unlucky in love to pray for a match. Why not try your luck and write your hopes on one of the pink love heart prayer plates?\nDirectly adjacent to Sanko Inari is Haritsuna Shrine, which has some interesting statues. In 1635, this was the place where the now nationally famous Inuyama Festival originated.\n### April festivities at the keep\nIn early April, Inuyama Castle is the backdrop for the Inuyama Festival, featuring 10-meter-tall floats pulled through the city before being lit up with hundreds of paper lanterns at night. As the city's cherry trees are usually in full bloom, it's a remarkable time to see Inuyama.\n### Other worthwhile things to do in Inuyama\nVisit the Urakuen Japanese Garden and the adjoining teahouse Joan, both of which are impressive examples of samurai culture. You'll find other interesting exhibits at the Inuyama Artifacts Museum and the Karakuri Exhibition Room, which are both free to enter with your ticket to the castle.\nWith so many sights to see and its many facets, plan at least half a day to explore Inuyama Castle, although it is possible to walk around the grounds and see it in a shorter timeframe.\n## Keywords"}

Norikura is both a major hiking destination and famous for its summer skiing.\n## How to Get There\nMt. Norikura is closed to private vehicles, so buses, taxis or bicycles are your only options. The road is closed from November to May or June with the exact dates depending on weather and which prefecture you are traveling from.\nFrom Gifu Prefecture buses leave from Hirayu Onsen every one or two hours, and take an hour to reach Norikura Bus Terminal.

The ride takes 50 minutes.\n### The great outdoors\nStraddling the frontier between Gifu and Nagano, Mt. Norikura is an essential part of any visit to the Okuhida area. There are three main reasons for visiting: leisurely strolling, serious hiking, or summer skiing.\n### Stepping out\nA 30-minute stroll will take you to the Katanokoya mountain hut. From there, the trail leads to Kengamine Peak, about an hour's walk.\nThe view along the way is spectacular. Vivid wildflowers shift tones throughout the season, and the autumn leaves spread across the Okuhida area are rightly famous.\n### Feed your mind and body\nOther beautiful sights include Ushidomeike, a large pond formed when Norikura last erupted, and Zengoro Falls. If visiting nearby Shirahone Onsen, try the spring water which is said to be good for the digestion.\n### The hills are alive\nFor those wanting a more in-depth tour of the mountains here, the trails continue on down to Norikura Kogen on the Nagano side. Even in the height of summer, the weather up here can change in a matter of minutes; cold-weather gear and proper climbing boots are a necessity.\n### Summer skiing\nWith the road closed in winter, skiing on Mt. Norikura then isn't an option, but the mountain is high enough that snow remains throughout the summer. There's decent traffic of thrillseekers hiking up and sliding down the mountain every summer—and the skiing is free.

The Nawa Insect Museum is an unusual spot, built by a man known as The Insect Man. It houses over 300,000 beautiful specimens, making it a big hit with children.\nNearby Shohoji is the home to a 14-meter tall lacquered Buddha (one of the three great Buddhas of Japan), and the Nagaragawa Ukai Fishing is a short walk away. Ukai fishing, using cormorants, is a tradition that has continued here for 1,300 years. You can see it performed between May 11 and October 15 every year.\nYou can cover the castle itself in an hour, but if you plan on visiting the museums and other attractions in the vicinity, you will need longer.\n## Keywords"}

The chairlift to the top of Mount Omuro is located across the road from the bus stop.\nTokai Bus offers two different one-day passes for Ito: one for 800 yen that covers Izu Kogen and the Jogasaki Coast, and a two-day pass for 1,500 yen that covers Ito City and almost all of Izu Kogen. The trip to Mount Omuro from Izu Kogen Station is fully covered by both passes, but the trip from Ito Station is only covered by the more expensive one.\n### Stroll around the bowl\nCatch a chairlift to the summit, which takes you right to a path that you can follow to circumnavigate the entire mountain in a half hour or less. The panoramic views will likely keep you circling for a while. On a clear day, you'll be able to see Mt. Fuji and Izu Oshima, the closest of the seven main islands in the Izu Island chain.\n©Ito city sightseeing department\n### Shoot arrows inside a volcanic crater\nIf you'd like to do more than just walk and gaze at the amazing views, you can take the stairs down into Omuro's volcanic crater and hone your archery skills. It may be hard to believe, but the mouth of a volcanic that once produced fire, lava, brimstone and ash is now an archery range. It costs just 1,500 yen an hour (for adults junior high school age and older), including the rental of the bow, arrows and glove, plus coaching from the range staff.\nAfter you've had your fill of the mountain itself, take the chairlift back down to the ground level and visit Izu Shaboten Zoo, which combines a vast number of cacti and other plants with a big petting zoo.\n### Cherry blossoms that linger\nAnother spot for nature lovers at Mt. Omuro's foot is the cherry blossom-viewing site called Omuro Yamazakura-no-Sato. Here, you can see 1,500 cherry trees of some 40 varieties from late September to May.\nSince not everyone can make it to Japan during the spring when viewing blossoms is a national obsession, this is a great option. Mt. Omuro is the perfect backdrop for this stunning cherry blossom scene.\n## Keywords"}

While it was inspired by castles that rose during the Momoyama period (1568-1600), it is one of Japan's newest castles, only dating back to 1959.\nThe view from the top, however, is magnificent, and there are plenty of fun things to do here.\n## How to Get There\nFrom Atami Station on the JR Tokaido Line, take the Yuyu Sightseeing Loop Bus to Atami Castle.\nAlternatively get off the Loop Bus at the Marine Spa Atami stop and take the Atami Ropeway to the top station; the castle is a short walk away.\n### A contemporary castle\nUnlike many other Japanese castles, Atami Castle is not a modern reconstruction of an earlier structure. In fact, it was built in 1959 just to ride the wave of Atami's tourism heyday, and it has always served purely as a tourism facility.\nHowever, it is in the style of castles built in the Momoyama period. This is why you may find that its external architecture seems rather similar to other structures from that era, such as Osaka Castle.\n### Top views\nThese days, Atami Castle is a one-stop tourism facility where you can explore different aspects of Japanese culture, from donning Edo-period samurai costumes to viewing erotic ukiyo-e displays.\nThe castle also pays tribute to its more historic brethren through an exhibition on other castles in Japan.\nBut the real highlight is the view from the castle's top floor overlooking Sagami Bay. It is particularly stunning in the spring when the cherry trees are in bloom. Summer is another popular time to visit because the front of the castle is a prime viewing spot for the Atami Marine Fireworks.\n## Keywords"}

Fuji富士登山\nMount Fuji, Fujinomiya-shi, Shizuoka-ken\n## The high point of a visit to Japan\nClimbing Mt. Fuji was once viewed as a religious pilgrimage to honor the spirit of what is one of the most beautiful and iconic peaks on the planet. An endeavor famed for its natural beauty and cultural significance, getting to the top of Mt. Fuji is an experience unlike any other.\n### Quick Facts\nMt. Fuji is actually a volcano but hasn't been active since 1707\nSaturdays tend to be the most crowded and the summit at sunrise is packed\n## How to Get There\nThere are various ways to get to the three trailheads for Mt. Fuji on the Shizuoka side by train and bus.\nTake a bus from Gotemba Station (on the JR Gotemba Line) to the Subashiri trailhead at the 5th Station, or the Gotemba New 5th Station Trailhead.\n### Choose your route up Mt. Fuji\nThere are four routes up to the peak: the Subashiri trail, the Fujinomiya trail, the Gotemba trail, and the Yoshida trail. All trails begin at what's known as the fifth station. Trails open on July 10 (except the Yoshida trail, which opens July 1), and close on September 10, although the dates may change depending on snow conditions. Each trail has its quirks, and they are all color-coded to keep you on track.\n### Stay warm, safe and on track\nIt may be steamy and hot when you begin climbing, but the summit can be rainy, windy and below freezing—even in summer. Bring warm waterproof clothes and plenty of water. Save some stamina for the trail down, too, because the incline and loose volcanic rock can be difficult to handle. Injuries are more likely while descending.\n### Catch the sunrise at the summit\nYou can climb Mt. Fuji during the daytime when the temperature is the warmest, but the best time to stand at its peak is during the sunrise. To catch the sunrise at Mt. Fuji, you can either hike from the middle of the night or stay in one of the mountain huts. With the night hike, you can avoid the hot summer sun and also enjoy the sunrise as you go up. Reservations are needed for the hut stay, and you should keep in mind that women and men share the hut in close quarters.\nSunrise on Mt. Fuji is a breathtaking experience. The sun first makes its appearance on the eastern horizon. Standing far above the clouds it's unlike any sunrise you've ever seen.\nThe latest information may differ, so please check the official website\n## Keywords"}

The displays range from being bathed in natural light to being in pitch-black surroundings with individual works of art illuminated by spotlights. Outside, the buildings are painted in bold colors, with sharp and curved lines blending together.\n### The extensive collection\nThere are over 300 works by Keith Haring on display at the collection, some from his instantly recognizable “Icons” series, while others are very early works, including drawings he made on the New York subway.\n“Andy Mouse” is a great homage to his hero and mentor, Andy Warhol.\nBesides paintings, the collection also includes sculptures, furniture, and modern items inspired by Haring.\n### An ever-changing atmosphere\nThe collection strives to represent the entire scope of Haring's work. Thus, the exhibitions and the rooms themselves are intended to evoke different emotions, with areas including the Room of Darkness, the Platform, the Room of Hope, and the Freedom Gallery.\nThe Pop Shop located in the middle of the museum are great places to relax while you digest the fantastic works of art that surround you.\nThe latest information may differ, so please check the official website\n## Keywords"}

The museum collects and exhibits work based on three fundamental principles.\nThe museum endeavors to deepen the relationship between people through photography, and to support young photographers from around the world. They collect and exhibit works from the year 1900 and beyond.\nThe museum is barrier-free, wheelchair accessible, and offers wheelchair rental free of charge.\n©KMoPA\n## How to Get There\nYou can reach the museum by train and then taxi.\nTake the JR Chuo Line to Kobuchizawa Station, and transfer to the JR Koumi Line to Kiyosato Station; the museum is 10 minutes by taxi from there.\n### A unique philosophy\nOne of the three basic principles of K\\*MoPA is \"affirmation of life.\" They provide a place for all works of art that celebrate life's boundless capacity for empathy, regardless of the method, subject, or medium of the artwork.\nEdward S. CURTIS《At the old well of Acoma, Keres》ca. 1904\n### Platinum prints\nTheir second basic principle is to collect platinum prints, a classical technique invented in the 19th century characterized by elegant colors and resilience. They collect and exhibit a wide range of classic and contemporary works from Japan and abroad, in the hopes of preserving this brilliant technique for future generations.\nKenro Izu 《Angkor#158, Ta Prohm,1994》 (c)Kenro Izu\n### Supporting young photographers from around the world\nThe third basic principle is the \"Young Portfolio\" initiative, to collect and preserve unique works of passionate young photographers from around the globe. K\\*MoPA believes that the artwork of young photographers under 35-years-old has the power to shape the future of the art world. They encourage young artists by purchasing and exhibiting their work, and giving them a platform to share their ideas.\n©KMoPA\n### Thinking globally\nK\\*MoPA is opened to photographers from Japan and the world over. While the history of photography has focused on the western world, they have turned their attention to other regions, such as APAC countries, Central Asia and the Middle East, Eastern Europe, Latin America, and Africa, to help present the unique expressions of artists in those regions.\n## Keywords"}

Nihonga is an approach to painting that adopts traditional Japanese tools, while using modern western techniques.\nThe Hirayama Ikuo Silk Road Museum explores Ikuo's older Nihonga works, as well as his most recent paintings of the Silk Road that he completed before his death in 2009.\n### Quick Facts\nThe museum houses around 9,000 items, with 6 galleries to explore\nThe museum was renovated and extended in 2008\nIkuo travelled to the Silk Road 150 times\n## How to Get There\nThe museum is just a few minutes by walk from the Kai-Koizumi Train Station. If you are coming by car, the Kobuchizawa Interchange is only 10 minutes away by car.\n### Treasures from the Silk Road\nHirayama Ikuo and his wife were avid collectors of anything tied to the Silk Road. They fought their entire lives to preserve and display works that they thought might be destroyed or lost due to political or religious upheaval in the area. This amazing collection allows generation after generation to learn about the cultural diversity tied to the Silk Road, and the pieces on display are as revered as the works by Hirayama himself.\n### Hirayama Ikuo's work\nOne of the many attractions of the museum is the extensive collection of Hirayama's art that graces the walls. On the first floor you can find galleries that celebrate his earlier work, including Continuous Stream (Ryusui-Mukandan) and European Sketch Collection (Oshu Shasei Emaki). The museum has such a rich library to choose from, which is often rotated to fit with themed exhibitions.\nOn the second floor you can find his later work that is very much in keeping with the theme that runs through the museum, his “Grand Silk Road” series.\n## Keywords"}

These trees stand as a testament to the ancient practice of venerating Mt. Fuji. Taro is the name of the tree at the front of the shrine, while Jiro, his twin, is at the back.\n### The lost path\nDuring the Edo period (1603–1867), followers of the Fujiko faith would begin their ascent of Mt. Fuji from a small gate located at the back of the shrine.\nAlthough it is still possible to walk directly from there to the top of the mountain, the path between the shrine and Umagaeshi, also the entrance to the Yoshida Trail, has been lost to time.

It is a popular destination and often busy, but even so, the peacefulness of the area persists.\n### A turbulent past\nThe eight ponds of Oshino Hakkai are the beautiful byproduct of historic eruptions and intense volcanic activity. Several are fed by an underground reservoir and are renowned for their mineral-rich spring water. The water in Waku Pond is so clear and clean that in 1985, the Ministry of the Environment ranked it among some of the nation's best spring water.\n### Facilities\nThe gift shop is seemingly as large as the village itself and sells a wide variety of gifts and souvenirs, as well as snacks. Much of what is on offer is adorned with Mt. Fuji motifs; you'll also find trinkets on sale celebrating the eight ponds.\nThere is a small coffee and ice cream stall inside. There are also local specialties such as tofu topped with local miso infused pickles, and kusamochi, a pounded rice cake that is green due to the addition of mugwort, an aromatic plant grown in the area.

The museum in the Fuji Five Lakes area is also undoubtedly one of the world's most remarkable museums devoted to textiles.\n### Quick Facts\nSimilar to tie-dyeing, tsujigahana was a technique used for dying kimono during the Muromachi period (1338-1573)\nItchiku Kubota had his first exhibition at the age of 60\nThe main exhibit hall makes use of ancient cypress trees to form its intricate structure\n## How to Get There\nThe Itchiku Kubota Art Museum is accessible from Tokyo by train or expressway bus and then by local bus.\nThe Itchiku Kubota Art Museum is located in Yamanashi, near the border of Shizuoka.

Visit in early November, when the contrast of dark green bamboo with fire-red Japanese maple leaves is quite remarkable.\nAs colorful as the garden is, however, nothing can prepare you for the profusion of colors on display in the museum's main exhibit. You will want to linger in the main exhibit hall to look at the fine details of each magnificent kimono on display.\n### A dramatic setting to display astounding kimono\nThe new wing of the museum is made of Okinawan coral and limestone, designed in the spirit of Gaudi. But inside the main building, the cypress structure is grand and, at once, cavernous and cozy. The wooden rafters of the structure provide a stark and stunning backdrop to the colorful and intricate kimono.\nMore than 100 kimono are on permanent display in the museum, but only a quarter of them are exhibited at any one time.\n### Explore the great details of Mt. Fuji\nSeasonal themes dominate the kimono collection. Fittingly, the artist captures the essential qualities of Mt. Fuji in great detail with designs that depict the sacred mountain throughout the seasons.\nThe collection's highlight is The Symphony of Light that was designed to be a string of 80 works representing the Four Seasons. The series comprises 36 kimono which highlight the beauty and changes of nature and the universe.\n### Room with a view\nThe museum and its garden were designed by Kubota himself, and the traditional tearoom is his former workshop.

Wander the trail and stop at one of its \"post towns,\" resting stops for fatigued travelers, to glimpse Japan as it was in the past.\n### Don't Miss\n- Visit historic Joshoji Temple in Suhara\n- Explore the checkpoint station at Kiso Fukushima\n- Hike over the Torii-toge Pass to Narai, once the wealthiest post town on the Nakasendo Highway\n## How to Get There\nThe Nakasendo Highway can be reached by train or highway bus.\nBy shinkansen, head to Nagoya before transferring to the JR Shinano Limited Express.\nAlternatives from Tokyo include taking limited express trains such as the JR Asuza via Shiojiri Station before making further transfers along the Kiso Valley route.\nThe famous post town of Magome in Gifu Prefecture is the most common starting point for accessing the Nakasendo Highway. Reach Magome by bus via Nakatsugawa Station.\nFor the adventurous, the walk between Magome and Tsumago takes about 2 to 2.5 hours.\nSignage is in English and Japanese, and luggage forwarding services are available.\n### Quick Facts\nThe roadway that became the Nakasendo Highway dates from the seventh century\nIt was originally called the Kisokaido before becoming Nakasendo in the early 1600s\nLocals refer to this highway as the Kisoji\n### Hike the Nakasendo Highway for a taste of old Japan\nFrom the early 1600s until the late 1800s, the Nakasendo Highway was an important trade route connecting Japan's capital Kyoto to Edo-period Tokyo.\nAlong the way, there were 69 post towns. These rest stations, spread out every 10 kilometers or so, provided accommodation and entertainment for merchants, samurai, wandering monks, and other fatigued travelers.\n### Where time stood still\nWhile most of the Nakasendo and its post towns have long ago succumbed to modern development, some portions of the Kisoji area remain almost untouched. Whether remodeled or quaint, the area allows an up-close look at life in rural Nagano.\n### Conquering the Nakasendo\nYou can walk the entire length of the trail in four to five days, but some highly motivated hikers do it in three. While you can obviously walk in either direction, many prefer to start in Magome at the valley's southern entrance and proceed north, as more of the journey is downhill. You'll pass a number of train stations along the way, so if you tire of walking, you can always take the train to the next town.\n### Meet Kiso's many Jizo\nA Buddhist Bodhisattva and roadside guardian, Jizo statues are commonly found along this path as are Dosojin, a Shinto icon shaped like a human couple, that's believed to protect travelers.\n### Traveling from Magome to Tsumago\nThese two post towns are two of the best-preserved stops on the entire Nakasendo Highway. Their main streets lined with beautiful wooden houses. The scenic three-hour, nine-kilometer hike between them takes you from Gifu Prefecture into Nagano Prefecture and the Kiso Valley.\nIt's worth spending a night at one of Tsumago's local inns to fully appreciate the atmosphere once the crowds clear out. Take an evening stroll among the old buildings with their glowing lanterns; you'll feel like you've slipped into another era.\n### From cedar to bamboo\nThe leg of the Nakasendo Highway between Tsumago and Suhara covers a variety of terrain and brings you through some lovely Japanese countryside, including forests of Japanese cedar and towering bamboo groves. The trek is rather long, 23 kilometers in all, but well worth the effort. The journey passes through the post towns of Midono and Nojiri before reaching Suhara if you decide you want to finish early and catch a train for Kiso Fukushima. Once you reach Suhara, be sure to check out the peaceful Joshoji Temple, founded in the 14th century.\n## Keywords"}

It's a long way from big city life and well worth the trip.\n### Don't Miss\n- Stroll along Ginzan River and the town's pedestrianized streets in your yukata\n- Visit Shirogane Park and cool yourself by its waterfalls\n- Stay overnight and dine at one of Ginzan Onsen's many hot spring inns\n- Take an outdoor rotenburo bath or enjoy a private kashikiri soak\n## How to Get There\nGinzan Onsen can be accessed by a combination of JR trains and buses.\nFrom Tokyo, take the JR Yamagata Shinkansen to Oishida Station (three hours, 20 minutes), then catch a bus to Ginzan Onsen (35 minutes). The train is covered by the Japan Rail Pass, but the bus is not. Be aware that buses only depart Oishida Station every 60-90 minutes.\nVisitors traveling by car are required to park at a designated parking area outside the town center. Many inns offer a shuttle service into town from the lot.\n### Get to know the onsen-kyo\nPopular among Japanese travelers, the term onsen-kyo is associated with small, quaint towns and cozy inns that offer accommodation, food and hot spring bathing. As weekend retreats, they are popular with all age groups, from young families to retirees. This cherished aspect of travel in Japan often goes unnoticed by foreign visitors, so live like a local and dive into onsen-kyo culture.\nThe area is a car-free town center with no modern buildings in sight.\nHaving checked into one of the town's many inns, visitors walk the streets without the usual concern of cars zipping past to beat the traffic light.\nIn the proud tradition of Japanese inns, Ginzan Onsen's ryokan offer up sumptuous local dishes to meet the standards of their mostly Japanese clientele.\n### Such stuff as dreams are made of\nBeautiful buildings surrounded by an unspoiled rural setting ensure that Ginzan Onsen is pleasant all year round. Long summer days are perfect for lazy strolls down idyllic streets in a yukata. In winter, the town really works its magic. The sight of the buildings blanketed in snow and illuminated by the soft glow of gaslights leaves a lasting impression.\nMany Japanese visitors come to Ginzan Onsen in search of its Taisho period ambience. Anyone familiar with Mishima Yukio's novel 'Spring Snow' will delight at how the setting blends traditional Japanese aesthetics with what was once seen as modern sophistication. The gaslights and absence of motor vehicles help maintain the atmosphere.\n### The finer points of hot spring bathing\nRotenburo are outdoor baths-usually hidden from outside view-which allow you to take in the surrounding scenery from the comfort of a hot spring. Another attractive option is arranging a kashikiri session in a private bath, whereby you and traveling companions can have a tub all to yourselves for a short time.\n### Silver everything\nUnsurprisingly for a town founded on a silver mine, Ginzan Onsen takes both its name (literally, Silver Mountain) and iconography from the element. The popular Shirogane Park boasts an impressive 22 meter tall waterfall, and you'll also find an illuminated cave which is well-lit and ideal for taking pictures.\n### Old meets new meets old\nGinzan Onsen's one notable concession to modernity is the Fujiya ryokan, a striking building designed by famed architect Kuma Kengo. With a blend of modern and traditional elements, including the incorporation of bare timber and white plaster, it stands out from its surroundings while also keeping one foot firmly in the past.\n## Keywords"}

It includes Momijiyama Garden, a beautiful little garden. It features soil piled up to resemble Mt.

Hakusan, Shirakawa-go is one of Gifu's must-visit destinations. Recognized by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site, this beautiful traditional village is the definition of picture-postcard perfect.\n### Don't Miss\n- Staying overnight in an authentic Japanese farmhouse\n- The traditional gassho-zukuri style houses, which were used to produce much of the silk in the Hida region\n## How to Get There\nShirakawa-go is best accessed by bus from Takayama.\nFrom Nagoya and Gifu take the JR Takayama Line to Takayama. Buses to Shirakawa-go leave from the Takayama Bus Center and take around 50 minutes.\n### Start at Ogimachi\nShirakawa-go Ogimachi is the largest hamlet of gassho-zukuri style houses in Japan. The name gassho-zukuri literally means \"like praying hands.\"\nEach house is a masterpiece of carpentry. They are built without nails—every beam slots neatly into the next. The structure is so sound that these houses have stood since the 1800s, even in this earthquake-prone nation.\n### Slip into the past\nThe existing gassho-zukuri houses serve as museums, explaining the history of the region, the special architectural style, and features, and some of the key industries of Shirakawa-go. Several of these homes are guesthouses that offer lodging.\nThe gassho-zukuri village will transport you back to pre-modern Japan. Climb up to the Shirayama observatory, look out over the village, and take in views of a time gone by.\n### Gassho-zukuri Minkaen\nThis outdoor museum was built by relocating unused gassho-zukuri houses in Shirakawa-go to recreate the traditional way of life. It features functional buildings such as storerooms and a temple, as well as the ubiquitous houses. Here, you can see demonstrations of local crafts, some of which you can have a go at. There are restaurants and souvenir shops, making it an excellent place to rest weary legs.\n### Doburoku Festival\nDoburoku is a local specialty alcohol. Doburoku is an unfiltered sake—a \"home\" brew that is illegal to produce in all but a few designated special zones.\nIn mid-October, you can partake of the drink while watching performances of the Shishi-mai lion dance.\n### Keeping house\nSome of the houses are still residences and are therefore understandably closed to the public. Others, however, are open and are definitely worth checking out.\nThe Wada House is right by the bus stop, in the center of Ogimachi, surrounded by a perfect Japanese garden.\nThe Kanda House is believed to be more than 150 years old and contains writing on the roof frame by the original carpenter from about 1850.\nThe Nagase House was home to a family of doctors and has a display of Edo period (1603-1867) medical equipment that is fascinating and troublesome in equal measure.\n### Tajima House Museum of Silk Culture\nSilk farming was one of the main industries in pre-modern Shirakawa-go, and this museum explains the history and process. The Tajima House is actually dedicated to reviving the traditional silk farming industry.\n### Myozenji Temple Museum\nThis former monk's residence next to the main temple has been turned into a museum of the temple's history since 1748. The temple itself is home to a large Buddha, and the bell tower and nearby yew tree are redolent of old Japan.\n### Glorious four seasons\nShirakawa-go rewards return visits, as the shifting seasons bring out different aspects of the town. From the bright cherry blossom through the verdant summer, the fiery autumn leaves and the silent, white winter, Shirakawa-go always looks splendid.\nYou can cover Shirakawa-go in a couple of hours, but to really soak in the atmosphere, imagine the timelessness of life in rural Japan, and lose the stress of contemporary living, you will need longer. Staying overnight in one of the lodging houses is highly recommended, but you will need to book in advance.\n## Keywords"}

Its fame even spread overseas, bringing illustrious visitors such as Charlie Chaplin, a trip commemorated with a statue in the town. Set aside a leisurely overnight trip—or longer—to Gero Onsen to soak in the hot springs and slip back in time.\n### Don't Miss\n- Bathing among the rocks beside Hida River\n- Climbing the stone steps to Onsenji to enjoy the view\n- Getting a taste of Shirakawago at Gassho Village\n## How to Get There\nGero Onsen is easily accessible from both Nagoya and Gifu.\nFrom Nagoya or Gifu City take the JR Takayama Line. It's about 90 minutes from Nagoya, and a bit over 60 minutes from Gifu. Coming down the same line from Takayama takes about an hour.\n### Eat, drink, and be merry\nGero is all about the onsen. The majority of visitors stay overnight in one of the many hotels or ryokan. Each one has its own baths reserved only for guests and serves delicious meals of local produce, often directly to you in your room.\nFor busy Japanese families, Gero is the ultimate in relaxation: you check in, and from that moment on you don't have to do anything. It's the leading way for the Japanese to let the strain of work ease away.\n### If you can't spend the night\nDay-trippers are also well-catered for. Gero Onsen offers three public baths and a free open-air bath beside Gero bridge—but be warned, people on the bridge can peer down on bathers.\nSome hotels and ryokans open their baths to the public at certain times of the day. Purchasing a yumeguri tegata (bath pass) will give you access to three of these, which is usually plenty.\n### Sights to see, too\nWhile most people come to Gero Onsen to bathe, eat, and sleep, the area isn't short of sightseeing options.\nOnsenji Temple sits above Gero and offers excellent views along the Hida River. The temple's Buddha is devoted to healing—a fine devotion, since the mineral content of Gero spring water is said to have restorative powers. The hot spring waters are said to be particularly effective for sufferers of skin conditions and arthritis.\nAnother beautiful temple, Zenshoji, is one stop further north on the Takayama Line. While walking around and sightseeing, you can take a relaxing break at any of the free foot baths that dot the city.\n### Step back in time\nThe fact that Gassho Village Open Air Museum is reminiscent of Shirakawa-go is not coincidental. Many of the thatched houses were relocated from the northern town. As well as admiring the architecture, visitors can take part in demonstrations of traditional artisan techniques.\nA morning market of local food and crafts will interest early risers. Of more relevance to Gero itself is the Gero Onsen Museum, which tells the story of the town's history.\n### Feeling festive\nEach August 1 to 3, Gero plays host to the Ryujin Fire Festival. Incorporating geisha dances, music and fireworks, this is the highlight of the year in Gero, and consequently, accommodation is hard to come by.\nA dance festival in February, kabuki performances in May and November and more fireworks at the end of the year are other festive options.\n## Keywords"}

Minobu身延山\nMinamikoma-gun, Yamanashi-ken\n## One of Japan's most important Buddhist mountain temples\nWith clear air and sweeping views, a trip to Mt. Minobu refreshes the soul and the senses. Devotees of Nichiren Buddhism, a branch of Mahayana Buddhism founded by Nichiren (1222–1282), have been making the pilgrimage to Mt. Minobu since its main temple, Minobusan Kuonji, was established here in 1274.\n### Don't Miss\n- Minobusan Kuonji Temple, established in 1274, and the resting place of the the Buddhist priest, Nichiren (1222-1282)\n- The ceiling of the main temple at Minobusan Kuonji, adorned with a magnificent painting of a five-toed Japanese dragon\n- Oeshiki Festival—celebrated on the second weekend in October—that marks the passing of Nichiren with illuminated floats and leather-fringed matoi poles\n## How to Get There\nMt. Minobu is easily accessible from Shizuoka and Shinjuku by train.\nTake the JR Tokaido Shinkansen Line to Shizuoka Station, change to the JR Tokaido Main Line for Fuji Station, then board the northbound JR Minobu Line for Minobu Station.\nYou can take an express train to Kofu Station from Shinjuku Station then change to the Minobu Line for JR Minobu Station (about 3 hours).\nTake a taxi or a bus from the train station to Minobusan Kuonji Temple. The taxi is about 2,000 yen, but the bus is only about 280 yen.\n### Staircase to enlightenment\nOne of the most striking features of Mt. Minobu is its 287 stone steps to enlightenment, known as bodai-tei. You need to be fit to climb these steps without a break, but your reward, if not enlightenment, is an impressive view of Minobusan Kuonji's five-tiered red pagoda.\n### Spectacular blossoms and a spinning festival\nAlthough close to 1.5 million people visit Mt. Minobu each year, most do so during cherry blossom season in mid-April to see the beautiful 400-year-old weeping cherry tree in front of the main temple.\nIn early October you can attend the annual Oeshiki Festival featuring frenzied spinning of matoi (long poles with leather strips attached to the top). Devotees of Nichiren Buddhism dance among the town's shops until they reach Kuonji Temple.\n### The ascent to the summit\nAlthough you can ascend the 1,153-meter mountain via ropeway, the 2.5 hour hike through cedar forests is rewarding. Along the way, you will see ancient graves and many smaller temples. To hike to the top, take the narrow road behind Kuonji Temple. The first grave you see is of an English ship's captain who joined the Nichiren sect in the late 19th century.\n### Reaching the top\nDepending on weather conditions, you should be able to see Mt. Fuji rising majestically from behind the mountain ranges, and a commanding view of the Fuji River as it winds its way to the Pacific Ocean. There is a spacious rest and observation area here.\n### The lesser temples\nOn the way up the mountain, there are many smaller temples worth visiting. The first one you see, known as Pomegranate Temple, has small wooden plaques offering prayers for healthy children (the pomegranate is a symbol of fertility in Japan). The second temple you encounter is filled with a thousand tiny golden Buddhas. In spring, the cherry blossoms shade the paths, while in early summer, hydrangea flowers dot the temple grounds with vidid blue.\n### Encountering pilgrims\nIf you are lucky, you may see actual pilgrims dressed in white. As the pilgrims ascend and descend the mountain, they chant \"Nam-myoho-renge-kyo,\" a chant for enlightenment.\n## Keywords"}
{"filename": "www.japan.travel_en_spot_2188.md", "country": "japan", "region": "tokai", "url": "", "title": "Unknown", "category": "general", "text": "# Tateyama Mountain Range立山連峰\nToyama-ken\n## A majestic mountain range\nAs the two major peaks in the Tateyama Mountain Range, Tateyama and Tsurugi form a magnificent backdrop to the east of Toyama Prefecture.\nStretching out like a jagged saw blade, the Tateyama Mountain Range can be climbed by travelers with the mettle to take them on.\n### Don't Miss\n- The famed mountain shrine of Oyama atop Tateyama\n- A two day trek to the peak of the legendary Mt. Tsurugi\n- An epic week-long trek from Tateyama to Kamikochi—Japan's most celebrated mountain course\n## How to Get There\nMost people access the major Tateyama peaks from Murodo via the Tateyama Kurobe Alpine Route. You can embark from either side of the route, with Tateyama Station on the Toyama side or Ogizawa (Omachi City) in neighboring Nagano Prefecture.\nFrom Toyama, travel from Toyama Densetsu to Tateyama Station. From Omachi station, go to Ogizawa Station then proceed to Murodo via the Alpine Route.\n### Geography\nThe northernmost section of Japan's Hida Mountain Range (or “Northern Japan Alps”) forks into two segments with the Kurobe Dam in the valley between them.\nTo the east, The Ushiro Tateyama Mountain Range borders Nagano Prefecture and is home to the famous ski resorts of Hakuba. To the west, the Tateyama Mountain Range is entirely in Toyama and more central to the prefecture's identity.\nBy far the most visually distinctive of the peaks, Tsurugi sits regally in the center like a rugged jewel in a crown. Just south of Tsurugi, the gentler contours of Tateyama belie the fact that it's actually the taller of the two. As major peaks in the Hida Mountains, Tateyama and Tsurugi also rank among the highlights of the Chubu Sangaku National Park.\n### Toyama's holy mountain\nThough usually spoken of as a single mountain, Tateyama actually has three peaks, with the best-known (Oyama) being only the second highest. Together with mountains Fuji and Hakusan, Tateyama claims the title of one of the country's Three Holy Mountains.\nLegend has it that an eighth-century hunter pursued a wounded bear all the way to Murodo only to see it transform into a golden Buddha. Thereafter, the hunter became a priest, tasked with tending to this new sacred place. Nowadays, the mountaintop shrine of Oyama is one of the mountain's main attractions.\nThe convenient location and relatively easy ascent makes Tateyama very popular during the warmer months. You may find that crowds are a greater obstacle to reaching the top than any difficulty in the course. So consider bunking down at a mountain lodge or hotel to break up your journey and ease tired muscles. Theoretically, you can do it as a day trip, but timing might be tight.\n### The big one\nTsurugi was the last major peak in Japan to be summited. It took until the year 1906 for officials from Japan's Land Survey Department to reach the top with many failed attempts which added to the mountain's aura of danger.\nThey had believed themselves en route to the first successful ascent, but on reaching the summit discovered a sword and staff dating from before the 12th century. The mystery of how these items got there remains unsolved.\nTateyama is a significantly easier mountain to climb than Mt. Tsurugi. It avoids the tag of 'technical climbing,' but only by having a well-maintained network of chains and ladders reducing the need for ropes and other climbing gear. Even with a sturdy chain to grasp, you'll still find yourself negotiating exposed ridges with sheer drops below.\nMost attempts to climb Tsurugi begin at Murodo where you can set off on foot for the Kenzanso Mountain Lodge. This facility, which operates from July to mid-October, is the ideal stop off point for a 10 to 12 hour hike. If you get an early start (say 4:30 a.m.), you can make it back to Murodo that afternoon to catch the last bus back to civilization.\n### Tateyama to Kamikochi\nThe six to seven day hike from Tateyama to Kamikochi (or the reverse) is one of Japan's premier treks.\nAfter alighting from Murodo, head east to Mt. Tateyama and beyond. From there, the basic breakdown of the hike is as follows:\nDay One: Murodo to Goshikigahara, six to seven hours, and you can climb Mt. Tateyama along the way if the weather cooperates.\nDay Two: Goshikigahara to Yakushidake Sanso, eight to 10 hours via another famous mountain, Yakushidake.\nDay Three: Yakushidake Sanso to Kurobegoro Goya, six to eight hours, includes yet another famous mountain, Kurobegorodake.\nDay Four: Kurobegoro Goya to Mt. Yarigatake, eight to 10 hours, ending at another iconic Japanese peak.\nDays Five and Six: Mt. Yarigatake to the Hotakadake Sanso to Kamikochi, 11 to 15 hours, the single most vaunted multi-peak excursion in Japan. Beginners beware! Things do get genuinely dangerous on the Daikiretto Traverse.\n### When to go\nAll of these hikes share the same July to early October window. Experienced, well-equipped hikers may opt to climb Tateyama as early as late April, after the Alpine Route has opened. Crampons are required gear, ice axes are recommended, and don't skimp on the cold weather wear. Casual hikers should plan a hike for July to mid-October.\nTsurugi follows the same rules as Tateyama with the caveat that early-spring hiking is much more dangerous on the more difficult mountain.\nFor the Tateyama to Kamikochi hike, mid-July to early October is best. Earlier in the season, residual snow presents problems for the lightly-equipped and some huts will not be open, discouraging amateur hikers.\n## Keywords"}

It's the perfect place for a break from the urban frenzy.\n### The inns\nThis centuries-old village used to get large numbers of pilgrims during the Edo period (1603-1867), but nowadays, very few people make the pilgrimage between Mt. Minobu and Mt. Shichimen. Currently, just one inn is operating. Enjoy your stay, nestled away from modern Japan, and enjoy the traditional atmosphere and surroundings.\n## Keywords"}

Shichimen七面山\nMinamikoma-gun, Yamanashi-ken\n## A mountain pilgrimage through ancient forests and villages, with temple lodgings waiting\nGetting to Mt. Shichimen and up to the summit is a multi-day affair. If you join the annual Monk's Run on the last Sunday in November, you may be able to make the 36-kilometer pilgrimage in a matter of hours, but for most people, two or three days is ideal.\nThe starting point, Minobu, is located in southern Yamanashi.\n### Don't Miss\n- The 287 stone steps to enlightenment at Minobusan Kuonji Temple\n- Walking along Akasawa's narrow streets to see the dozen or so original inns\n- The two magnificent waterfalls located between Akasawa and the entrance to Mt. Shichimen\n## How to Get There\nRail access is via JR Kofu Station, a key station on the line connecting Tokyo and Matsumoto, or JR Shizuoka Station on the JR Tokaido Shinkansen Line.\n### Mt. Minobu first\nTo ensure that you reach Akasawa Village before you lose the light, the first stage of this pilgrimage is best attempted no later than noon. If you cannot arrive in Minobu early enough, you should consider staying at one of the temple inns near Minobusan Kuonji Temple.\nStart your hike at the base of Mt. Minobu, which begins just behind the main temple at Kuonji, and is punctuated by ancient graveyards, temples, and shrines.\n### Akasawa Village next\nAfter you have reached the top of the mountain and visited the mountaintop temple, you will descend to the ancient village of Akasawa. The village with its dozen or so inns, fields of green tea, and dramatic mountain vistas, is an unforgettable sight.\nAlthough you can theoretically walk from Mt. Minobu to the top of Mt. Shichimen in around nine hours, consider spending a night at the inn known as Osakaya. Be prepared to bring your own food, as meals are currently not available at this inn. You are more than welcome to use the inn's kitchen facilities.\n### At the peak of Shichimen\nBefore you ascend Mt. Shichimen, purify your body under one of the dramatic waterfalls near the entrance to the mountain. As you climb, you may want to stop at one of the covered rest areas along the trail.\nAt the summit, you can spend the night at the temple inn attached to Keishinin Temple. A very reasonable price buys you basic lodging and two temple meals.\nIn addition to attending the evening prayers at the temple, be sure to see the sunrise over Mt. Fuji from the temple gate at the summit.\n## Keywords"}

The blades they crafted were coveted by lords and samurai throughout Japan.\n## How to Get There\nSeki is accessible by train.\nFrom Gifu Station, take the JR Takayama line to Mino-Ota and change onto the Nagaragawa Railroad. Seki Station is seven stops along the line.\n### At the cutting edge\nSince the Mino sword-making tradition was founded in Seki area, this place has been synonymous with blades. When Japan embraced modernity in the early Meiji era (1868-1912), however, samurai were banned from carrying swords, and the bottom fell out of the market. Artisans diversified into knives, scissors, cutlery, and other tools, for which Seki is still renowned.\n### Swordsmith museum\nYou can catch a glimpse of one of Japan's most respected arts at the Seki Swordsmith Museum, just a few minutes' walk from Nagaragawa Railway Hamono-Kaikanmae Station.\nIn addition to displays of every aspect of sword making, on designated days you can watch the smiths at work, pounding steel and literally making sparks fly. January 2 is the day you most want to be there, when the first forging of the year is accompanied by solemn rituals and festivities.\n### Cut the price\nThe Gifu Cutlery Hall is between the museum and the station, a well-stocked shop offers every kind of Seki blade you could hope to purchase, from nail clippers to replica swords, kitchen knives, and scissors. The samurai sword scissors are a particular favorite with visitors. Items are sold at discounts up to 20%.\n### Seki Zenkoji\nSeki Zenkoji, located a short walk beyond the museum, is named after the much bigger, more famous Zenkoji Temple in Nagano City. Like Nagano's Zenkoji Temple, Seki Zenkoji also features a pitch-black underground passageway, where you walk with your hands touching the walls on either side and try to find the metal door handle purported to lead to the realm of the dead.\nThe latest information may differ, so please check the official website\nPlease note that the name of the Hamonokaikan-mae Station will change to Sekiterasu-mae Station on April 11, 2022.\n## Keywords"}

The closest one, Ekimae-koto Onsen, is a two-minute walk from the station, while the furthest one, Shibaseki Onsen, is about a 30-minute bus ride.\n### Soaked in history\nAccording to legend, the hot spring water in the area was first used by the gods Sukunabikona and Okuninushi in the 8th century. The pair visited Iyo-no-Kuni, which is now known as Ehime Prefecture. While visiting the area, Sukunabikona fainted from illness. To cure him, Okuninushi piped water from Beppu Onsen to the ancient Dogo Onsen, which miraculously cured Sukunabikona.\n### The bath of samurai\nLater, in the Kamakura Period (1185-1333), wounded samurai bathed in Beppu Onsen to help speed recovery. Today, locals and tourists alike journey to the area to soak, for relaxation of the body and mind.\n### The perfect water for all types\nHot spring water varieties range from those high in chloride to those high in sodium bicarbonate. Many of the baths are claimed to be beneficial for illnesses like neuralgia, rheumatism, and fatigue. You can also try drinking the spring water at some hot springs (please check with staff beforehand), which is said to help gastroenteritis, diabetes, and gout.\n### Record-breaking onsen hub\nThere are close to 3,000 hot spring sources in Beppu City, representing more than 10% of all vents in Japan. Beppu City boasts the largest volume of hot spring water in Japan.\n### Onsen highlights\nBe sure to visit Ekimae-koto Onsen, the closest hot spring resort to Beppu Station.

The sweeping grasslands of the area are scattered with white limestone mounds and conical sinkholes. The Karst extends along rolling mountains and has multiple trails with expansive panoramas of the Shikoku region and the Pacific Ocean.\n### Don't Miss\n- The mossy trails and ancient trees of Keyakidaira\n- Other-worldly stargazing opportunities\n- Scenic hikes and stunning seasonal blooms\n## How to Get There\nHard to reach by public transport and therefore suited to intrepid travelers, this pristine natural hideout can be accessed by car from Kochi and Matsuyama or a combination of taxi, bus and train travel from Kochi Station.\nIf you choose to rent a car, the scenic drive from either Kochi or Matsuyama takes around two hours. The journey by public transport and taxi requires a number of changes.\nTo get there via public transport, depart from Kochi Station and arrive at Susaki Station to catch a bus towards Yusuhara. Change again at Shinden and take a taxi to Hoshifuru Village Tengu (formerly Tenguso), in the middle of the Karst. During the winter months, some areas of the Karst become inaccessible due to snow.\n### Quick Facts\nThe area is split into three parts; the Tengu Highland, Keyakidaira and Mezurudaira\nThe karst has an elevation of 1,400 meters\nThe area straddles both Ehime and Kochi prefectures\n### A place for all seasons\nThe Shikoku Karst transitions seamlessly with the seasons. Spring sees the grasses turn a vibrant hue of green. On hikes through the area in summer, you can see lilies all around. Old man of the mountain and forget-me-nots also dot the hillsides.\nRich, vibrant leaves cover the trees during fall months, whilst the grass turns a striking shade of silver. Then in the winter, you may find a dusting of the purest white snow covering the hillsides.\n### Forest bathing\nThe hiking trail in the Tengu Highlands that passes through Tengu Forest is a great way to soak up the area's incredible beauty. Look out for the Japanese cypress wood-chip paths meandering through the forest, which are surrounded by stunning white birch and red pine trees.\nThe walk takes approximately three hours and at the end of it, you are rewarded with fantastic views of the Shikoku mountains and on a clear day, the Pacific Ocean.\n### The great outdoors\nDuring summer months, camping is the perfect way to immerse yourself in the tranquil atmosphere of the Karst. The Mezurudaira area has plenty of campsites where you'll find pastoral scenes of cows lazily grazing. The Karst is so far from any major cities there is little to no light pollution, making it the perfect spot to stargaze.\n### A riot of color\nThe nearby Ogawamine area includes several notable mountains. Kasatori, Ogawamine, Mikawamine, and Ubahodo all reach heights of between 900 and 1,500 meters. In spring, the mountains are carpeted with the bold magenta rhododendron flowers. On a clear day, you can see Mt. Ishizuchi and the Sata Peninsula nearby.\n### Warm hospitality\nIn the midst of the Karst's Highlands sits the Hoshifuru Village Tengu (formerly Tenguso) and Mezuruso Cottages. Taste the flavors of the mountains, such as pheasant and wild boar served alongside the best of seasonal produce.\nHoshifuru Village Tengu has a large bath which looks over the Pacific and the Ishizuchi mountains, and is the perfect place to unwind after a long day of hiking. At Mezuruso, try amago, a red spotted masu trout from the nearby rivers of Kumakogen, cooked on an outdoor charcoal fire. Both accommodations also have campsites.\n### Starlight, waterfalls and fairytale villages\nMuch like Shirakawa-go, the thatched farmhouse village of Kumakogen Furusato Ryoko Mura could have been lifted from a fairytale. The planetarium and observatory offer unimpeded views of the twinkling night skies. Nearby, Omogo Gorge and Goraiko and Gongen waterfalls draw visitors with their clear rippling waters and dense surrounding forest.\n## Keywords"}

The main means of transportation to the area are Osaka, Kyoto, and Nagoya using the Kisei Mainline (also known as the Kinokuni line).\nTo access Kumano Nachi Taisha Shrine and Nachi Seigantoji Temple, take a 30-minute bus from Kii-Katsuura Station (on the JR Kinokuni Line) to the parking lot in front of the shrine and temple.\nAccess Kumano Hayatama Taisha via a 15-minute walk from JR Shingu Station, also on the JR Kinokuni Line.\nKumano Hongu Taisha is approximately an hour and 15 minutes from Kii-Tanabe Station (on the JR Kinokuni Line) via Ryujin Bus on the Kumano Hongu Line.

The pilgrimage gradually became more widely known from that time.\n### The spiritual triumvirate of Kumano Sanzan\nKumano Sanzan is the collective name for the area's three most sacred shrines: Kumano Hayatama Taisha Shrine, Kumano Nachi Taisha Shrine (including adjoining Nachi Seigantoji Temple) and Kumano Hongu Taisha Shrine.\nTogether they are the sacred center of the Kumano region. Uniquely designed and originally offering separate forms of nature worship, the three eventually merged, becoming a major pilgrimage destination.\n### 99 Oji Shrines as spiritual signposts\nWhile the Kumano Sanzan shrines remain the big draw of the pilgrimage, many smaller shrines are scattered along the route. Known as the 99 Oji Shrines, their purpose is to provide protection and guidance for the wandering pilgrims.\n### Religious harmony through Shinbutsu-shugo\nBefore political policy forced them apart in the late 19th century, Buddhism and Shinto coexisted quite peacefully as Shinbutsu-shugo, a fusion of the two belief systems. Shinto gods were considered to be indigenous manifestations of Buddhist deities. This was the norm in Japan for over a thousand years.\nIn the 19th century, Buddhism was separated from Shinto and many temples and Buddhist statues were destroyed.\nWhile it's relatively rare to find Buddhist and Shinto elements intertwined today, Kumano Nachi Taisha Shrine and the adjoining Nachi Seigantoji Temple illustrate the traditional relationship very well.\n## Keywords"}
