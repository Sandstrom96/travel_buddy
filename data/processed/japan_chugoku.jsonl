These are additional perks for visitors exploring the prefecture's peace connection, shrines and museums\nThe city of Hiroshima is a great place for trekking through dense forests and enjoying natural hot springs. Discover quaint towns like Onomichi and Tomonoura or enjoy golden beaches, the islands of the Seto Inland Sea, and the iconic Itsukushima on Miyajima—the floating shrine with a red gate set in the sea. Hiroshima's other World Cultural Heritage site, the Atomic Bomb Dome, and its surrounding memorial park are monuments to peace. Hiroshima is also famous for savory okonomiyaki pancakes, anago or saltwater eel, and other culinary delights. Hiking, cycling, ocean sports, and skiing are all popular outdoor activities.\n## How to Get There\nHiroshima is easily accessible via the JR Tokaido-Sanyo Shinkansen from Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, Kyoto, and Fukuoka in the other direction. It is also served by domestic and international flights to Hiroshima International Airport, local trains from and highway bus services.\nMeanwhile, Hiroshima International Airport has direct flights to and from Taipei, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Dalian. A limousine bus from the airport takes less than an hour to reach the city center.\n### Don’t Miss\n- The memorial Peace Park is home to countless memorials and the iconic Atomic Bomb Dome\n- Miyajima with its floating red torii gate that serves as the entrance to Itsukushima\n- Takehara, or “Little Kyoto,” with its historic buildings, interesting museums and great sake\n- Kure—the city that built the legendary battleship Yamato—and its museum\n## Explore Hiroshima by Area\n- \\\\\nInland Hiroshima\n- \\\\\nHiroshima City\n- \\\\\nMiyajima\n- \\\\\nOnomichi & Fukuyama\n- \\\\\nKure\n- \\\\\nTakehara\n## Trending Attractions in Hiroshima\n- Itsukushima-jinja ShrineItsukushima-jinja Shrine\\\\\nItsukushima-jinja Shrine\n- Hiroshima Atomic Bomb Dome\\\\\nHiroshima Peace Memorial (Atomic Bomb Dome)\n- Okunoshima\\\\\nRabbit Island (Okunoshima)\n- Takehara\\\\\nTakehara\n## Local Specialties\n- Miyajima Woodwork\nThe island of Miyajima is home to a woodworking tradition that produces turned, hand-carved, ornamental designs.

Momiji manju taste of wheat and honey, while the bean jam has a smooth, mellow sweetness.\n- Hiroshima Oysters\nHiroshima serves up some of Japan's biggest oysters, rich and briny and served raw or grilled. A true local specialty is a set meal of rice, miso soup and deep-fried oysters served with tartar sauce.\n- Tsukemen\nThis deconstructed ramen comes with the noodles and various toppings in a bowl or plate, and the soup in a separate vessel. You dip the noodles and toppings into the piping hot soup before eating.\n- Hiroshima Okonomiyaki\nUnlike its Osaka cousin, Hiroshima's take on the savory pancake of sliced cabbage, flour, egg and dashi layers its ingredients rather than mixing them together. It is served on a bed of griddle-cooked noodles. A true Hiroshima comfort food.\n- Kumano Brushes\nKumano is the brush capital of Japan, producing 80 percent of the country's fude. This traditional technique once reserved for making painting and calligraphy brushes now includes luxury makeup brushes.\n- Fukuyama Koto\nThe Fukuyama koto is the only Japanese instrument designated as a traditional craftwork. These 13-stringed musical instruments are aural and visual works of art, both inside and out.\n## Seasonal Highlights\n- Spring\nSpring brings the cherry blossoms as well as hundreds of thousands of tulips and roses to Hiroshima. This is also the time for the Spring Gourmet Festival, and for the young rabbits on the island of Okunoushima—also known as Rabbit Island—to emerge from their burrows.\n- Summer\nSummer festival time is here, including the Mihara Yassa Festival, Obon dancing, and others. The annual memorial event at the Peace Park occurs August 6, starting in the morning and ending with a river filled with glowing paper lanterns. (Photo: Courtesy of Hiroshima Prefecture)\n- Autumn\nThe leaves change, and in particular the gorges of Sandankyo and Taishakukyo are known for their fiery autumn colors. Get there before the areas close for the winter season.\n- Winter\nNew Year's celebrations enliven the temples and shrines, and thousands take the ferry to Miyajima to visit Itsukushima Shrine.

Thousands write messages of peace on paper lanterns that are lit at sunset to float down the river past the iconic remains of the Atomic Bomb Dome. Anyone can join the lantern ceremony.\n### Don't Miss\n- The Peace Park, filled with memorials to those that died in the atomic bombing of 1945\n- The Atomic Bomb Dome, a somber monument to the nuclear legacy\n- Hiroshima's version of okonomiyaki\n- An excursion to nearby Miyajima for the deer and much-photographed floating shrine\n## How to Get There\nHiroshima City is easy to reach by rail or air.\nYou can reach the city from Tokyo by shinkansen in around four hours, or about 90 minutes from Osaka. If you prefer to fly, Haneda Airport to Hiroshima Airport takes around 90 minutes.\n### More than memorials\nHiroshima City treats its tragic past with honor and respect, but it does not dwell on it. The city is full of plenty of lighthearted fun as well.\nHiroshima is known for its robust food culture. One local specialty is okonomiyaki. The savory pancake is popular throughout Japan with different regional twists. Hiroshima's version is cooked on a base of noodles layered with pork and cabbage, so it goes down well with a cold beer or two.\nOysters are also a local delicacy, served both raw and cooked in a variety of ways, including battered and deep fried. The cultivation of oysters in Hiroshima is said to go back to the 16th century.\n### Take me out to the ball game\nBaseball fans should try to catch a home game of the Hiroshima Toyo Carp at Mazda Stadium.\nThe Carp have been in the central league since 1950 and have won the league championship nine times and the Japan championship three times. Their fans are known for their passion, and they have a large base of female fans, known as \"Carp Joshi\".\n### Streetcar desires\nWith a population of just over 1.1 million people spread out over a 900 square kilometer area, Hiroshima City sprawls out from the bustling city center. Getting around is easy, thanks to the modern tram service called Hiroden.\nThe streetcars have been a mainstay in Hiroshima since 1912, though the vehicles themselves have been updated to be more efficient and environmentally friendly. With around 300 trams in service, more than any other city in Japan, they make for a convenient and scenic way to see the city.\n### Vibrant nightlife\nThe bright lights of Ebisucho mark the best area for a lively drink or three. There are countless bars, clubs, cafes and eateries of all kinds. Between November 18 and 20, the Ebisu Festival is held to celebrate all the weird and wonderful things this area has to offer."}

The area boasts scenic destinations like Taishaku Gorge and Sandankyo Gorge.\n### Don't Miss\n- Onbashi Bridge is an amazing natural limestone bridge carved out by the river\n- Hiking and canoeing in the Sandankyo Gorge\n- The Taishaku Gorge in fall\n## How to Get There\nThe quickest and easiest way to get the area is by car from Hiroshima City.\nIt takes around two hours by car from Hiroshima City. For Taishaku Gorge take a train or bus from Hiroshima to Tojo Station on the JR Geibi Line in roughly two hours. From Tojo Station, take a Shiju Line bus to Taishaku Gorge. For Sandankyo Gorge take a bus from Hiroshima Bus Center.\n### Far from the crowds\nStunningly beautiful, Taishaku Gorge and Sandankyo Gorge are popular with domestic sightseers but are somewhat hidden gems amongst overseas visitors.\n### Mountain high, river deep\nIf you enjoy hiking, be sure to visit Sandankyo Gorge and Taishaku Gorge. Sandankyo Gorge offers boat rides and canoe hire, and Taishaku-kyo has the fantastic natural limestone bridge, Onbashi Bridge. The area is exceptionally beautiful in autumn when it draws many local visitors with their cameras.\nAnother recommended activity is to rent a bicycle and cycle the 20-kilometer long Taishaku Valley, stopping by Taishakuten Eimyoji Temple along the way. The main temple hall is set against the limestone cliffs of Mt. Sekiun, a dramatic backdrop to this Buddhist temple, originally established in the 8th century. The Azuchi-Momoyama period (1573-1603) carvings on the main hall are particularly beautiful.\nThe Taishaku river runs into Shinryu Lake, where you can cruise the area by boat; it takes around 40 minutes and costs 1,500 yen for adults or 750 yen for children. The clear lake waters reflect the three beautiful red bridges that cross it. During fall when the leaves are at their most vivid, the cruise can get rather busy.\n### Local specialties\nThere is no shortage of great food and drink in the area. Seishu is a type of refined sake, and the Shinrai brewery has been perfecting their craft since 1716. Try the steamed red bean buns sold around the area that have a subtle alcohol aroma to them."}

The city remembers its past with the Yamato Museum housing a scale model of the famed battleship, along with actual vehicles and weapons from the era.\nCourtesy of Hiroshima Prefecture\nCourtesy of Hiroshima Prefecture\n### From shipbuilding to sake\nKure's most famous export today is the sake made at the Sempuku Brewery. The brewery first opened in 1856, producing mirin (a kind of sweet sake for cooking), then started making sake in 1902.\nThanks to Kure's naval connections, the company was able to sell their sake to naval bases across the country. There is a tasting corner at their Gallery Miyakeya Shoten to experience their famous brews.\n### Food and festivals\nKure City has no shortage of festivals, which range from the Food Festival in November that sees Kuramoto-dori Street lined with food stalls selling local specialties, to the Port Festival in April, which includes local foods and yacht races.\nThe bay is lit up with fireworks in August, and for seafood lovers, there is an Oyster Festival every February in Chuo Koen.\n### The origin of a home favorite\nBecause much of its history is tied to manual labor, the culture of Kure is down-to-earth. The signature dish, niku-jaga, is a simple stew of potato, carrots, and beef, said to have become popular amongst sailors and engineers, and now popular nationwide."}

Although the port is quieter today, it is still central to the city's culture. Every April the Onomichi Minato Matsuri, or Port Festival, draws huge crowds and honors the city's rich history with food stalls, parades, and a dance competition.\n### City on a hill\nOnomichi is built on steep slopes with plenty of winding stone stairways to test your fitness. It's also one of the most picturesque towns in Hiroshima, thanks to the narrow streets with stunning views, the many shrines and the local cats that lounge idly, awaiting photographers. Onomichi is the start point of the Shimanami Kaido, a popular 60km cycling route that links the town to Shikoku.\n### Shrines, temples, and pilgrims\nFukuyama and Onomichi are home to many beautiful shrines and temples that range up and down the slopes around the cities. Several temples are part of the Chugoku 33 Kannon Pilgrimage route, including Myooin Temple in Fukuyama, and Senko-ji, Jodo-ji, Saikoku-ji and Kojo-ji in Onomichi.\n### Beautiful beaches and sunset spots\nThe area has beautiful beaches such as the white sand Shimanami Beach, surrounded by lush green forests. Setoda Sunset Beach is a long, sandy retreat, which as the name implies, is the perfect spot to enjoy the sunset over the many small islands that dot the Seto Inland Sea.\nTachibana Beach looks out across the impressive Innoshima Bridge. There are also dozens of other beaches in the area to discover.\n### Natural hot springs\nAfter a day climbing up and down the scenic slopes or enjoying the cycling routes, you can relax in one of the area's natural hot springs. Onomichi Fureai-no-Sato is one of the largest facilities, with restaurants and a hotel onsite. Other top spots include Poponoyu, accessible by bus or taxi from Onomichi Station and Bella Vista Spa and Marina, which offers luxurious accommodations and views over the bay.\n### Local cuisine\nWith a mild climate, the area is famous for fresh fruits like lemons and sweet mikan oranges. Thanks to the local fishing industry, the area is known for kamaboko, the compact slices of fish paste often seen in ramen dishes, as well as tsukudani, an intensely flavored topping for rice, often made from fish or seaweed.\nOnomichi Ramen is famous. The soup is a light mix of soy sauce and chicken bone broth served with flat noodles and silky chunks of pork fat."}

The peaches are very sweet and exceptionally soft.\n- Okayama Grapes\nFarmers in Okayama have been growing grapes since the Meiji era, and they have honed their skills over the 100-plus years.

The latter holds a 90 percent market share in Japan, and for good reason.\n- Bizen Ware\nProduced in one of Japan’s six ancient potting centers, Bizen yaki has been around since the 5th century.

The Okayama Prefectural Youth Education Center is now affiliated with this historic site, which hosts learning events for regional children. The tree-covered grounds of Shizutani form what is essentially a Japanese-style garden, complete with an ornamental carp pond, as well as cherry trees and a large Chinese pistashio tree. Accordingly, spring and fall are ideal times for a visit.\n### Famous seafood market with oysters served every way\nHinase is a quaint fishing town with an excellent seafood market called Go-mi-no-ichi famed for its oysters. You can buy directly from the market and grill them up at the barbecue spot across the street or take them away. There are also a number of reasonably priced restaurants near Hinase Station if you want a sitdown meal.\n### Explore islands close by\nThe Hinase Islands are a group of islands accessible by ferry from Hinase Port. An approximately 30-minute ferry ride will take you to Otabujima Island, the furthest out from the port. Otabujima has a guesthouse that is a popular retreat for families and groups.\n### Well-established bridge system\nA series of bridges make visiting both Kakui and Kashira Island possible by car. Kakui is a bird sanctuary with camping facilities, and Kashira has a wonderful swimming beach.\n### Famous movie backdrop\nHattoji Furusato Village is a picturesque hamlet located in the Yoshinaga district of the city of Bizen. It looks like something out of a Japanese period film, and in fact it was the backdrop for the 1989 movie Kuroi Ame or “Black Rain” (not the U.S.-produced film of the same title).\n### Take a spin on a 34-kilometer cycling course\nKatatetsu Roman Kaido Route is an approximately 34-kilometer cycling course that runs along a former railway line. In 2003, this cycling and walking path was opened to the public allowing for a slow-paced view of the nature along the way.\nBicycle rentals are available at both ends of the course and at various stages in between. You can opt to do the full course, a one-way trip, or just a section.\n### And of course there's Bizen ware\nThe biggest draw in Bizen is Bizen-yaki, or Bizen ware, which has a long history and is a highly regarded form of pottery in Japan. Bizen pottery appeared in the 14th century, but can be traced back to the 6th century. You can find many shops selling Bizen ware throughout Bizen and Okayama.\nBizen ware is best known for its reddish, earthen tones, but comes in a range of colors and styles. What is relatively constant, though, is that Bizen ware is fired unglazed in a wood-fired kiln, using red pine, and usually simple in form.\nYou can learn more about its history and contemporary revival at the Bizen Pottery Museum. If you're inspired to try throwing your own, visit the nearby Pottery Workshop Mugenan."}

Experience a trot around the corral or riding outside the park.\nOutside of the park, you can ride through lush green meadows during the spring and summer or through the harsh, snow-covered ground of winter.\n### For families and young kids\nFor an activity that smaller children will certainly enjoy, visit the Hiruzen Kogen Center Joyful Park. This small theme park features classic carnival rides that are familiar around the world. The park's 30 attractions include a Ferris Wheel, Viking ship, and go-kart course.\n### The hot springs of Hiruzen\nAnother reason that many people visit Hiruzen is to soak in one of the many hot springs. Some of them welcome day trip visitors, while others are only available for those making an overnight stay. Of course, a stay in an onsen ryokan or hotel will give you more time to explore the natural environment and outdoor activities of the region. With the extra time, you may even take the opportunity to trek out to one of the many waterfalls and picnic by a riverside.\n### Fresh ice cream and foodie fun\nIn Hiruzen, dairy farming is a key industry. A popular treat is the locally produced ice cream. While summer is when its popularity hits its peak, it is popular all year round.\nThe dairy industry is such an important part of the fabric of Hiruzen, there is even an agriculturally based theme-park in Hiruzen-Kogen—Jersey Land. Here, you can mil a cow, make cheese, and enjoy delectable dairy.\nThe Hiruzen Jersey Land restaurant offers plenty of hearty fare—their specialties include steak, cheese fondue, yogurt, milk, and ice cream. The produce, sourced from nearby farms, is also incredible. Be sure to drink the milk too.\nThere is a bounty of herbs on offer at the Hiruzen Herb Garden Her Bill. With more around 200 varieties of herbs and around 10,000 plants, its no wonder the restaurant, which has a workshop and store, calls itself Kaori-no-Yakata—the House of Scent.\nAn idyllic landscape, clean air, great food, soothing waters, and a paradise of herbs makes Hiruzen-Kogen Highlands an ideal nature getaway."}

The city stretches out to a bustling industrial port and is known as the birthplace of jeans in Japan.\n### Don't Miss\n- Stroll through the Kurashiki Bikan Historical Quarter and cruise on the river\n- Tour the Mizushima industrial zone by night\n- Find the perfect pair of jeans or try “denim” ice cream in Kojima\n## How to Get There\nKurashiki is accessible from Okayama City by train and bus.\nTake the Sanyo Line from Okayama Station to Kurashiki Station, covered by the JR Rail Pass. Local trains go to other parts of Kurashiki. The historical quarter is a ten-minute walk from the station.\n### A haven for shoppers\nKurashiki is known as Japan's jean capital, bringing trend-hunters from around the world. The area around Kurashiki Station has a wealth of choices, from shopping malls and an outlet park to retro covered shopping streets. You can walk almost the entire way from the station to the Kurashiki Bikan Historical Quarter along a traditional “shotengai” or covered shopping street, lined with shops selling traditional crafts, daily goods, and groceries.\n### Japan's own Venice\nThe most popular spot for visitors is the beautifully preserved Kurashiki Bikan Historical Quarter. Large traditional houses, stores and warehouses, most dating back to the Edo period (1603-1868) and Meiji period (1868 - 1912) line a pretty river, crisscrossed by stone bridges. Small boats ferry passengers back and forth along the river. Like Venice, this picturesque area is a living town, with shops, vibrant cafes and restaurants and locals going about their daily lives.\n### A temple to art\nIt's clear from the size of the traditional houses along the riverfront that Kurashiki has been home to some wealthy merchants. One of them, Magosaburo Ohara, founded Japan's first private art museum in 1930, to show off his collection. He was also the patron of a local painter, Torajiro Kojima, who traveled around Europe, picking out pieces for his benefactor, including works by El Greco, Gauguin, Monet and Matisse to sit alongside contemporary Japanese works. As a result, this small museum, resembling a Greek temple, is a gem of 20th century Western and Japanese art.\n### Get the blues\nThe Kojima area of Kurashiki was the first place in Japan to manufacture denim, and it's still known as the jeans capital of Japan, drawing shoppers and designers from all over the world. Part of its success is the number of small, specialist workshops using traditional machines and dyeing techniques that mass-production cannot replicate. The hip shopping area is high on the list for serious denim connoisseurs, but casual shoppers will also find everything from jeans and jackets to offbeat accessories, along Kojima Jeans Street.\n### Venture off the beaten track\nBeyond the main tourist spots are some interesting areas that will give you a taste of daily life. On the coast, the port town of Tamashima dates back around 400 years, with some well-preserved houses and traditional artisans around Nakagai-cho. In summer, head for Sami Beach, a peaceful swimming area with a laid-back atmosphere.\nFor a different side of Kurashiki, head to Mizushima, the area's industrial powerhouse, home to well-known manufacturers, such as JFE Steel and Mitsubishi. Many of the factories offer tours (prior reservation is advised). On one tour, you can watch the whole car manufacturing process at Mitsubishi motors. The area looks a little grey in the daytime, but by night, it glitters with the lights of industry.\nMabi Town is an inland agricultural district, known for its extensive bamboo groves and bamboo products. The town is the birthplace of Japanese scholar Kibi-no-Makibi who studied in China 1,300 years ago and has a beautiful Chinese style garden, Makibi Park, and a popular camping area, Mabi Utsukushi Mori."}

Others come for the hot spring waters. There's also a mountaintop castle here that appears to float on the clouds and festivals with plenty of visual and aural excitement.\nFor foodies, the Niimi area offers great food and wine in a prefecture known throughout Japan for its fisheries and farming.\n### Don't Miss\n- Wine tasting at Domaine Tetta\n- Sampling some prime Chiya beef\n- Visiting one of the many caves or waterfalls\n## How to Get There\nNiimi can be reached easily by train from Okayama Station in about 90 minutes.\nThe best way to tour the Niimi area is by car. You can rent a car in Okayama and drive to Niimi via Route 180, which is a major thoroughfare from Okayama to Yonago, with Niimi in the middle. You can also rent cars in Niimi itself.\n### Visit historical buildings\nThe Fukiya Furusato Village in Takahashi City is an Important Preservation District for Groups of Traditional Buildings and visitors can wander around the narrow streets flanked by the distinctively red wooden buildings. The area is also famous for other buildings of historical interest. The former Fukiya Elementary School operated until 2012, and was the oldest working wooden school building in Japan at the time. It is now an Important Cultural Property of Okayama Prefecture and will reopen to the public from April 2022 after undergoing restoration work.\n### For wine lovers and foodies\nTetta Town in Niimi is home to one of Okayama's famous vineyards, Domaine Tetta, situated on a mountaintop. The award-winning winery has recently opened a cafe to give visitors a foodie experience to enjoy with the wines.\nThe Chiya area in Niimi is where Chiya beef is raised. You'll find Chiya beef at high-end restaurants in Tokyo and Osaka, but Niimi has more reasonably priced restaurants where you can enjoy a prime cut or two.\n### Hot soaks and cool powder\nThe Chiya area has one of the area's largest onsen resorts. At Niimi Chiya Ibuki-no-Sato Onsen, you can enjoy a daytime soak without an overnight stay. Either way, you can enjoy lunch or dinner after your bath, including grilled Chiya beef if you like.\nDuring winter there are lots of snow activities to enjoy with the family. The Ibuki-no-Sato Ski Resort has a ski area, complete with three lifts and five runs, with a variety of rails and a wall for snowboarders and freestyle enthusiasts.\n### Air and underground adventures\nOsa Town is famous for its paragliding and adventure activities. Located in a valley, it is a perfect location to try paragliding.\nNiimi is one of the best locations in Okayama to view fireflies (from May to July). Osa Town is known for its paragliding and adventure activities. There is a spectacular fireworks show in summer, and rice harvest festivals. River and cave trekking are exciting activities to do year round.\nThe caves of Ikura-do and Maki-do are popular places, and there are fishing spots along the Takahashi River. Areas near dams offer hikers a place to explore lush green forests.\n### Castle in the clouds\nBitchu Matsuyama Castle is one of only 12 castles in Japan that has an original keep. The castle is located in the town of Takahashi on a mountaintop at 430 meters. The surrounding area is often filled with clouds that fill the area below the castle, giving rise to its nickname, \"Castle in the Sky.\"\n### Festivals and revelry\nOctober 15 is the day Niimi holds its Daimyo Parade, remembering when feudal lords inspected their lands before heading to attend on the Shogun in Edo (modern-day Tokyo).\nThe procession travels through downtown Niimi, and many of Niimi's residents are involved, dressed in warrior armor, as flag bearers, and even children in traditional kimono. The highlights include the carrying of portable shrines ornately decorated in blue, black, red and gold, as handsomely groomed horses walk proudly.\nAnother favorite event is held on Children's Day, May 5. The event is one of the prefecture's larger fishing tournaments. Children are guaranteed to catch something in a special pond filled with fish. For serious anglers there are great prizes for the largest fish caught, and the Takahashi River offers lots of spots to sit and drop your line.\nDuring the festivals, the old Niimi central shopping street is filled with food stalls and other activities."}

It is home to Okayama Castle, known as the Crow Castle, and Korakuen Garden, which is considered one of the top three traditional gardens in Japan. The nearby town of Kurashiki is famous for its canals and beautifully preserved Edo townscape.\nYou're likely to enjoy fine weather on any trip to the Okayama area, which calls itself the Land of Sunshine and reportedly has more sunny days than anywhere else in the country.\n### Don't Miss\n- Explore the city's cultural zone\n- Join the raucous Naked Man Festival\n- Take a trip to an art island\n## How to Get There\nOkayama City is easily accessible from Tokyo and Osaka by shinkansen and air.\nYou can reach Okayama Station on the JR Tokaido-Sanyo Shinkansen from Tokyo Station and Shin-Osaka Station. Okayama is served by Okayama International Airport, which you can reach from both Tokyo airports and Kansai International Airport.\nPeaceful Korakuen Garden\n### Nightlife, nature, and culture within walking distance\nThe center of the city is within walking distance of Okayama Station. All of the core highlights of Okayama— the castle, Korakuen Garden, museums, hotels, and malls—are close by.\nThe \"Crow Castle\" overlooking Asahi river\nThe two most-visited sites in Okayama City are Okayama Castle and Korakuen. Separated only by the Asahi River, they are connected by a bridge.\nThe castle earned its nickname, Crow Castle, because of its black walls. The great keep's six stories look majestically over the river, Korakuen and the city. On the other side of the river, the peace and beauty of Korakuen Garden, initially constructed at the behest of a feudal lord, makes it difficult to imagine that great battles were once fought over control of this territory.\nOne of Japan's top landscape gardens, Korakuen features meticulously kept lawns, various groves of cherry and other trees, rice and tea fields, a pond, streams, an aviary, and walking paths.\n### Fight for your right to fortune\nOkayamans love their festivals, so attending one is a great way to put your finger on the pulse of the city. The summer festival features a carnival-like atmosphere, with dance performances by local troupes and a spectacular fireworks display.\nAnother festival that has received more attention internationally is the Saidai-ji Eyo Matsuri, usually called the Naked Man Festival. At Saidai-ji Temple on the third Saturday of February, thousands of male participants dressed in nothing but loincloths brave the night cold, vying to capture scented wooden shingi sticks and 100 bundles of willow strips blessed by a temple priest. The items are thrown into the crowd from the second floor of one of the temple buildings. The action is akin to a massive rugby scrum, with a lot of bashing about and quick-handed snatches.\nAnyone who gets hold of the shingi and thrusts one upright in a wooden measuring box known as a masu is blessed with a year of happiness. With over 500 years of history, this fertility festival is also conducted in the hope for a good harvest.\n### These islands are worth taking to the sea\nNot all the festivals in Okayama are wild. Take the ferry out to Inujima Island in the Seto Inland Sea, where the island itself is part of the Setouchi Triennale. Although this art festival is celebrated only once every three years, the island is known for art installations that have been placed in former private residences, several museums with extraordinary exhibits, and a laidback culture that belies the island's origins as a pirate hideout.\nManabeshima is a picturesque little fishing island that has been a filming location for a number of Japanese movies and is apparently pleasantly overrun by cats. For cycling, swimming and sea kayaking, try Shiraishijima.\n### Edo days lovingly preserved\nNot far from Okayama Station is the town of Kurashiki. Once a major center for transporting goods, the town's traditional storehouses, and merchant homes have been converted into boutiques, cafes, and museums. The latter includes the Ohara Museum, which offers a large collection of works by famous Western artists. Take a slow boat on the canal to view the lovingly preserved townscape.\n### Buy your time at the mall\nOkayama's favorite modern place to be and be seen is the AEON shopping mall. With a mind-boggling 350 stores, restaurants, cafes, movie theaters, bookstore, banks, game centers, beauty salons, yoga studio and travel agents, you could spend a lot of time and still not see everything. One of the local TV stations does a show there where passersby can look into the studio window and see the live broadcast."}

Tsuyama is the larger of the two, but the region is known by the name of the other smaller town, Mimasaka-no-Kuni, meaning the \"Land of Mimasaka.\" The whole of northern Okayama Prefecture makes up this ancient domain, where Miyamoto Musashi, one of the most famous samurai warriors, was born. The founder of Shorinji kempo, So Doshin, was also born here.\nThe region is an excellent destination for campers, outdoor sports enthusiasts and onsen fans, and there are some lovely gardens and the ruins of a castle to explore. You can also drive on a genuine Formula One track.\n### Don't Miss\n- Visiting the Musashi Budokan\n- Driving on an authentic Formula One track\n- Having a picnic in Kakuzan Park under the ruins of Tsuyama Castle\n## How to Get There\nThe Tsuyama/Mimasaka area takes up a large part of northern Okayama Prefecture. Access to the area is easiest from Tsuyama Station, from which you can use buses to get around.\nA train from Okayama Station to Tsuyama Station will take about 70 to 90 minutes depending on the type of train and time of day.\nRenting a car from Okayama City is a great option, since it will give you more freedom to use Tsuyama as a base where you can drive to Mimasaka, Ohara, Maniwa, or Tottori. There are several car rental facilities near Okayama Station.\n### Birthplace of two of Japan's famous martial artists\nMimasaka is a rural city rich in history and culture. The great swordsman, philosopher and artist Miyamoto Musashi was born in what is now Mimasaka. The Musashi Budokan is a grand structure where his spirit lives on. Musashi's birthplace and the Musashi Budokan are two excellent locations to add to your itinerary.\nThe founder of Shorinji kempo, So Doshin, was also born in Mimasaka, and there's a memorial hall in his honor in the Sakuto area of the city. Sakuto is home to Shiramizu Waterfall and the Sakuto Museum of Fine Art, both of which are sightseeing spots popular with couples.\n### The call of the highlands and racing thrills\nContinuing your journey, visit the Oashi Highlands, where you can enjoy camping, hot springs and the great outdoors any time of the year. The nearby Okayama International Circuit is an authentic Formula One course where Michael Schumacher once raced to victory. You can take your own car or motorcycle out for a lap or two.\n### Soak in history or just the hot springs\nWith a 1,200-year-old history, the relaxing waters of Yunogo Hot Spring attract throngs of visitors each year. The spa offers both public and private bathing options. Both overnight and day visits are welcome, and aromatherapy and craft-making workshops are available if you wish to spend additional time here.\n### Tsuyama Castle during springtime\nTsuyama was a castle town for centuries, but after the Meiji Restoration the city's castle met the same fate as many throughout Japan and the castle was dismantled. Despite this, the city retains the charm of a typical castle town, with many sightseers coming to visit its ruins.\nThe Yoshii River, which runs through the city, connected the town to the outside world. It's still a place where locals go to unwind and celebrate. Kakuzan Park surrounds the castle grounds and is considered a great place for viewing cherry blossoms in Okayama.\n### Reflecting the gardens of Kyoto\nAnother visual wonder in Tsuyama is Shurakuen Garden, which was designed to resemble the gardens of Kyoto. It was completed in the mid-17th century and captures nature in an idyllic form.\nOne of the best time to visit Tsuyama is in summer during the Tsuyama Noryo Gongo Festival. Held on the banks of the Yoshii River, vibrant summer kimono and festival attire bring summer to life, and food stalls with local delicacies line the river."}

Long before there was a Kyoto or Nara, this region was the center of what was known as the Country of the Gods. Japan's oldest records mention this area, and the shrines and historical treasures unearthed here are clear evidence that the roots of the Japan story are in Izumo.\n### Don't Miss\n- Izumo Taisha Grand Shrine, one of the oldest Shinto shrines in Japan\n- Gakuenji Temple, where Benkei once trained\n- Hiking the Chugoku Nature Trail, which leads to Izumo Taisha and Tachikue Gorge\n## How to Get There\nYou can reach Izumo by plane, rail, and bus. Okayama is the transport hub for most rail journeys.\nThe Tokaido-Sanyo Shinkansen Line connects Tokyo, Osaka and other major cities with Okayama. From Okayama, JR limited express trains depart for Izumo and take around three hours.\nFor flights to Izumo, JAL operates a route between Haneda and Izumo Airport. ANA flights from Haneda serve nearby Yonago Airport. Flights to Izumo Airport are also available from part of Fukuoka and certain other major airports.\nHighway buses, including overnight buses, connect the area with Tokyo and Osaka. For a more comfortable overnight option consider the Sunrise Izumo, the last sleeper train still operating in Japan, which runs between Tokyo and Izumo. It leaves Tokyo at 10 p.m. and arrives in Izumo 12 hours later.\n### Quick Facts\nIzumo Taisha Grand Shrine is dedicated to Okuninushi no Mikoto, a deity closely associated with love and marriage\nBronze objects excavated from remains of Kojindani and Kamo Iwakura, point to the extent of the power of the people in Izumo in ancient times\n### Land of gods and myths\nIn the ancient chronicles of Japan, the 8th-century Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, the beginning sections relate stories of the first deities and the creation of Japan. The first cycle of myths is set here in Izumo, not in the area around Nara and Kyoto.\n### Explore the most ancient shrine in Japan\nMany of the shrines in the Izumo area figure prominently in these ancient myths and the beginnings of Japanese culture. None is more famous than Izumo Taisha. All of Japan's Shinto deities come here during the tenth month of the old lunar calendar. The shrine is dedicated to Okuninushi, now known as the god of love and marriage, and people travel here from all over Japan to pray for success in finding a marriage partner.\n### Alongside the largest stone lighthouse in Japan\nAnother shrine that features in the ancient chronicles is nearby Hinomisaki-jinja, nine kilometers up the coastline from Izumo Taisha near the tallest stone lighthouse in Japan.\nThis highly picturesque shrine is very close to the sea, and like Ise-jingu Shrine, is dedicated to the same sun deity, Amaterasu Oomikami. Where Ise-jingu protects Japan during the daytime, Hinomisaki-jinja protects Japan during the hours of darkness.\n### From legend to history\nMany dramatic archeological discoveries suggest that the essence of the Izumo myths is based on reality. At Kojindani, a small valley near Lake Shinji, a staggering 358 bronze swords were unearthed, and the largest ever cache of ritual bronze bells was found at Kamo-Iwakura, testifying to the importance and power of the ancient people of Izumo. These may be seen in the museum next to Izumo Taisha Grand Shrine.\n### Find out more in the Shimane Museum\nThe Shimane Museum of Ancient Izumo, a huge, modern museum next door to Izumo Taisha Grand Shrine, has many exhibits on the history of Izumo Taisha, including models of how the shrine may have once looked when it was a towering 48 meters high. In the hills of Izumo City are a cluster of burial mounds of the 3rd-century rulers of the region. At the Yayoinomori Museum, you can learn about the tombs, excavated artifacts, and history.\n### Temple hidden behind a waterfall\nIt's not all history in Izumo. Gakuenji Temple, deep in the mountains, was once where a large number of monks trained. Though few buildings from this period remain, one particular structure you should visit is built into a cliff behind a waterfall. The tranquil precincts are filled with photographers in November, when autumn leaves art at their peak.\n### Nature on the way\nNot far away, Ichibataji Yakushi is a temple that draws pilgrims from all over Japan and is renowned as a place for healing people with eye problems. From its mountaintop location, you can look down on the Sea of Japan in one direction and Lake Shinji, Japan's seventh-largest lake, in the other.\nIf you like walking, hike the nationally known Chugoku Nature Trail, which connects Ichibataji Yakushi and Gakuenji temples, and leads to Izumo Taisha Grand Shrine before heading into the mountains through the dramatic Tachikue Gorge, a nationally recognized scenic spot home to 150-meter-high cliffs and spires of rock, and filled with thousands of Buddhist statues.\n### Explore the region\nIzumo is convenient as a base to explore the surrounding area. Inland, the area known as Okuizumo, the birthplace of the myth in which a deity slays an eight-headed, eight-tailed serpent to save a princess.\nLess than an hour from Izumo is Matsue, with one of the few surviving castle keeps in Japan, some world-class gardens, and the former home of famed writer Lafcadio Hearn. Just over an hour away to the west is the World Heritage site, the Iwami Ginzan Silver Mine."}

Cruising Matsue's canals is another highlight.\n### Don't Miss\n- Exploring one of only 12 original castle keeps in Japan\n- The world-famous gardens of the Adachi Museum of Art\n- Sunset over Lake Shinji, Japan's seventh-largest lake\n## How to Get There\nMatsue can be reached by train, air and highway bus.\nMatsue is two hours and 40 minutes by train from Okayama, where the shinkansen connects to Osaka in 50 minutes and Tokyo in three hours and 20 minutes.\nThe Sunrise Izumo is one of Japan's few remaining overnight sleeper trains. It travels from Tokyo to Matsue. Highway buses connect Matsue with Hiroshima and Okayama in only three hours. Highway buses run at night from Tokyo to Matsue and Izumo as well.\nThe two nearby airports, Izumo and Yonago, connect Matsue to Fukuoka, Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya.\n### Welcome to the \"City of Water\"\nThe town is located on the shore of Lake Shinji, the seventh-largest lake in Japan, and the river around the castle is connected to the moat. For these reasons, Matsue is known as the \"City of Water.\" The shores of Lake Shinji offer many places of interest and plenty of hot springs, all accessible by rail.\n### Exploring the area by boat\nExplore the canals around the samurai residence district via the Matsue Horikawa boat tour. Or view the Kaga no Kukedo sea caves with a boat tour along the coastline of nearby Shimane Peninsula.\n### The castle, samurai homes, and a writer who illuminated Japanese culture\nThe castle and surrounding samurai district contain many museums and historic sites in a compact area that you can easily explore on foot. From the top of Japan's second-largest original castle keep, you'll have a feudal lord's view of the city and surrounding area.\nMatsue's most famous foreign resident was a Greek-Irish writer named Lafcadio Hearn (1850-1904), who lived there in the late 19th century. Reading his book Glimpses of an Unfamiliar Japan will prepare you for what you find in and around Matsue, and give you ideas for places to seek out. You can visit his former residence in Shiomi Nawate, and the Koizumi Yakumo Memorial Museum.\n### In the distant mists of the past\nIn the 8th century, the area where Matsue is currently located was the center of government in the Izumo region. Many shrines in the area predate that time and connect with the stories of the deities that created the islands of Japan.\nYaegaki Shrine, Kumano Taisha, and Suga Shrine are all associated with the most ancient of Japanese myths, and near Iya Shrine is Yomotsuhirasaka, the mythical entrance to Yomi, the underworld. Miho Shrine, in a tiny fishing village at the easternmost tip of rugged Shimane Peninsula, has an unusual collection of musical instruments and great views of towering Mt. Daisen across the water.\n### Out past the city limits\nMatsue is the perfect base for visiting sightseeing spots in the area. Just 40 minutes away by bus is Sakaiminato, home to the spooks, ghouls, and monsters of the manga and anime artist Shigeru Mizuki.\nIzumo Taisha, the oldest and biggest shrine in Japan, plus a wealth of ancient sites of myth and prehistory can easily be reached by the two railway lines on the shore of Lake Shinji. Ferry services for the Oki Islands leave from nearby Shichirui Port or Sakaiminato Portfor the beautiful Oki Islands, with beaches where you can enjoy swimming, snorkelling, and scuba diving as well as sea kayaking."}

Sanbe & Iwami\n## A third of the world's silver was once supplied by Japan, and much was mined here\nMt. Sanbe, sitting near the center of Shimane, belongs to Daisen-Oki National Park and is the main peak in a range of volcanic mountains. It's an iconic symbol of the Iwami area, which boasts natural hot springs. Nearby is Iwami Ginzan, a registered World Heritage site.\nThe area is full of the charms of an earlier age. When you have explored the history and culture, the area's forests and beautiful beaches are uncrowded and well worth exploring.\n### Don't Miss\n- The views from the top of Mt. Sanbe\n- A mineshaft that runs through a mountain\n- Kotogahama, the \"singing sands\" beach\n## How to Get There\nMt. Sanbe and Iwami Ginzan are a 20-minute drive or 30-minute bus ride from Odashi Station on the JR Sanin Main Line, which runs along the west coast of western Japan.\nBy limited express train Izumo City, with its great shrine, is only 20 minutes away, and Matsue is an hour away. The shinkansen from Okayama takes three and a half hours, or three hours from Shin-Yamaguchi. Highway buses from Hiroshima take about two and a half hours.\n### A World Heritage area with the charms of a past age\nPass through the most popular, eastern area of Shimane to arrive in the Iwami area, which has an ancient atmosphere. Iwami, located in the western part of Shimane, is home to Iwami Ginzan Silver Mine, which was registered as a World Heritage site in 2007. The beautiful natural landscapes are a place where traditional lifestyles thrive, and the environment is preserved. A popular tourist attraction of the area is Mt. Sanbe.\n### Dormant for 4,000 years\nThe rounded slopes and peaks of Mt. Sanbe, part of Daisen-Oki National Park, overlook quiet, narrow, wooded valleys dotted with small farms. It's not a very high mountain, but it rises above the surrounding countryside and gives you expansive 360-degree views.\nThere are plenty of trails to hike up, some more strenuous than others. Some of the trails pass through wide-open grassy areas and others through forests of beech. Surrounding the peak's base are several hot springs, and around the start of the most popular, and shortest, trailhead are camping areas, parks, a nature museum and other facilities.\nNearby is the Sanbe Jomon-no-Mori Museum, a unique facility that exhibits a buried forest, where visitors can see giant trees that were buried about 4,000 years ago when Mt. Sanbe last erupted.\n### A third of the world's silver once came from Japan, and much of it came from here\nFrom the top of Mt. Sanbe, you see a serrated line of mountains that were once home to one of the richest silver mines on the planet. Iwami Ginzan, which means \"Silver Mountain of Iwami,\" is now a UNESCO World Heritage site, set in a sparsely populated region that reportedly once had a quarter of a million people working for it.\nDuring the 16th and 17th centuries, one-third of the world's silver was mined in Japan, and the majority came from here. It was a driving force of the economy of Japan and its trade with the outside world. At the World Heritage Center, you can learn all about the mine and decide which of the many sites spread across the area you want to visit.\nMany people explore one of the mineshafts that are open to the public and pass right through the mountain. Omori is well worth a visit, a one-street town below the mines that looks much as it did centuries ago and where you can visit homes of the samurai who controlled the mines and of the wealthy merchants who made their fortunes here.\nThe World Heritage site includes the roads that stretches from the mines to the coastal port, including Yunotsu, a famous historic hot spring town.\n### Glorious, secluded beaches\nSomething else you will see from the top of Mt. Sanbe are some fantastic beaches. which are comfortable and not too crowded. One of the best is Kotogahama—more than one kilometer of fine white sand with turquoise seas. The sands here are said to sound like a koto as you walk on them, and at the nearby Nima Sand Museum, you can see artworks made from the sand as well as the world's largest hourglass, which takes one full year before it needs turning."}

Yurahime-jinja Shrine was built facing an inlet, and legend has it that the sandy beach was covered with schools of squid between December and New Year's Day. Watch rituals at these shrines and other places around the islands.\n### The smaller islands\nNakanoshima is the lowest-lying of the islands, with a high point of 246 meters at Mt. Atodo.

It is said that the Oki tradition of Bull Sumo, still popular today, began here as entertainment for him. The underwater exploration boat called the Amanbow departs from here.\nHome to only 600 people, the tiniest of the inhabited islands is Chiburijima. The land is rugged, making it difficult to make a living from agriculture.\nThis small island is home to some impressive sights, such as the view of the Oki Islands from the top of Mt. Akahage, or the striking red rocks of Sekiheki (Red Cliff)."}

The serving method comes from soldiers in feudal Japan finding ways to heat their food in the aftermath of battle.\n- Yamaguchi Blowfish\nA beautifully arranged dish of fugu, sliced raw blowfish, is the height of Japanese gourmet cuisine. Fugu can be deadly poisonous, so only licensed chefs in Japan may prepare this delicacy.\n- Ouchi Lacquerware\nOuchi nuri is characterized by its distinctive coloring—the foundation is vermilion, not your typical black. Common motifs include autumn flora and the diamond-patterned Ouchi crest of the region's 14th-century warlord. For centuries, couples have sought out Ouchi bina, lacquered dolls symbolizing wedded bliss.\n- Hagi Ware\nHagi ware is practical pottery, all about simple forms and textures. Its charm comes from subtle details like the fine cracks, mottling and colors in the glaze. Tea aficionados prize its patina, the effect known as cha-nare that appears as tea slowly stains the stoneware.\n- Akama Inkstones\nThe master craftsmen who produce Akama suzuri require no less than three skills: explosives, mining and carving. For over 800 years, calligraphers have preferred Akama inkstones, heavy with quartz and iron, for the way they bring out the color and luster of ink and their stunning designs.\n## Seasonal Highlights\n- Spring\nLocated at the southwest tip of Honshu, Yamaguchi has some of the earliest-blooming cherry blossoms on the main island. The castle ruins in Hagi City and around Kintaikyo Bridge in Iwakuni are popular blossom viewing spots.\n- Summer\nIts coastal location makes Yamaguchi a major seaside destination. Kikugahama Beach, the cool limestone caverns of Akiyoshido, and local orange ice cream in Hagi are highlights of the summer.\n- Autumn\nFall at Tokoji Temple in Hagi offers blissful walks amongst stone lanterns and red maple leaves. The brilliant foliage also cuts a swath across Kikko Park in Iwakuni.\n- Winter\nDuring winter, you can heat up body and soul in Yuda Onsen’s outdoor ashi-yu foot baths, or try steaming kawara soba served on a hot roof tile in downtown Yamaguchi City."}

The new religion was initially accepted, and many in Japan began to practice Christianity. However, the feudal lords resented this outside incursion, and the persecution of Christians soon began.\nDespite this, the practice of the religion continued in secret. Francis Xavier Church, built here in 1952 on the 400th anniversary of Xavier's death, is dedicated to the memory of this missionary, who traveled around Yamaguchi from 1550-51.\nWith its sloping roof and white walls, the modernist structure stands out from other more traditional sites in Yamaguchi, but is nonetheless linked to the history of the prefecture and beyond.\n### The bath of the mythical white fox\nLocated a short walk from Yuda Onsen Station, this hot spring district is one of the most popular areas in Yamaguchi City.\nFor the overnight traveler, there are a wide variety of onsen ryokan hotels to choose from.

This garden can be considered a semi-stroll garden.\nIt unfurls like a scroll painting. The pond is in the shape of a crane flying west, and in it the island is shaped like a turtle. Both the turtle and crane are symbols of longevity.\nThe garden is populated with elements that change with the passage of the seasons: in spring the weeping cherry tree blossoms, azaleas flower in May and in the summer all is lush green. Autumn turns the maples red, but it is in winter, after snowfall, when many consider it the most evocative of Sesshu's paintings.\n### The story of Sesshu\nBorn in rural Okayama in 1420, as a young boy Sesshu was sent away to train as a Zen monk, and quickly showed an aptitude for art. At this time he received the name Toyo. Later he moved to Shofukuji temple in Kyoto and studied under Shubun, the greatest painter of the day. Once established as a painter in his own right he took the name Sesshu.\nSesshu moved to western Japan and painted most of his masterpieces there. The art of the time was based on the ink-painting techniques of China's Song dynasty, but Sesshu is credited with altering the style and making a distinctively Japanese version that has remained influential to this day.\nHe returned to Masuda towards the end of his life and is buried not far from the Sesshu Memorial Museum.\n### Exploring inside the temple\nWandering the rooms of the temple will reveal a wealth of art, including some lovely folding screens (though none of them were done by Sesshu) and a delightful 18th-century painting of the Buddha entering Nirvana. Worth looking out for is the Kaizan-do, a small hall of the main building which has a collection of rakan statues.\nRakan were the disciples of the Buddha, and a feature of their statues is that each one is carved with a unique expression. There are only 16 here, rather than the 500 found at some places, but the details and facial expressions are very beautifully carved. They were carved from single blocks of red pine.\nAfterward, head to nearby Manpukuji Temple, only 500 meters away, where another Sesshu garden awaits.\n### Manpukuji Temple—the other garden\nManpukuji, one of the oldest temples in the region, was relocated to this spot in 1374 by the 11th lord of Iwami, Masuda Kanemi, who made it his family temple. It has quite a different appearance to Ikoji Temple, more minimal in design and with less decoration, which is also how the garden here appears. This is a view garden meant to be enjoyed from the veranda. With advance notice you can reserve matcha green tea and cake.

All three offer their own versions of this healing, invigorating experience, and each deserves a visit.\n### Don't Miss\n- Taking part in the Salamander Festival\n- An evening stroll through town dressed in a yukata\n- Watching fireworks in the heart of a rural onsen town\n## How to Get There\nYubara Onsen:\nTake the Chutetsu bus bound for Hiruzen from Tenmaya Bus Center in Okayama City to Katsuyama Station. From there, catch the Maniwa City Community bus from Katsuyama Station to Yubara Onsen.\nOkutsu Onsen:\nTake the Tsuyama Line from Okayama Station to Tsuyama Station.

Then take a 10-minute taxi ride to the hot spring.\n### Yubara Onsen, a haven for salamanders\nYubara Hot Spring is just downstream from Yubara Dam. Although it is a public onsen, it feels private and secluded because of its pristine natural environment. The onsen waters bubble up from the riverbed, making the river sands billow, creating Yubara's \"sand baths.\"\nThe open-air Yubara Onsen bath is free of charge, with unisex bathing as well as a bathing area for children. The adjacent Municipal Yumoto Onsen-kan has a more traditional setting, including sauna, jacuzzi and family baths.\nDuring your stay, take a walk through the town and visit the local shops, folk museums and culture centers. Learn about the unique qualities of the region, including the town's mascot, a giant salamander.\nThe Hanzaki Giant Salamander Festival, held at the beginning of August, is a large annual area event that celebrates both its celebrity amphibian and the success of the town.\n### Okutsu Onsen, where locals still wash their laundry\nOkutsu Onsen is famously named bijin-no-yu, or \"bath of beauty.\" While traditionally the reference has been to the qualities of the water and its effects on a woman's skin, it is more a reflection of the idyllic life found in this onsen town.\nOkutsu is famous for the tradition of local women washing laundry in the river while moving in a rhythmic dance and wearing colorful regional costume. Their dance is still performed for visitors on Sundays and holidays, excluding the winter months.\nIf you are in the area between late October and mid-November, join the Okutsu Maple Leaf Festival's opening ceremony held at the Okutsu Shinko Center. The festival includes the night illumination of Okutsu Gorge, where the changing colors of the leaves mark the arrival of autumn.\n### Yunogo Onsen, fit for a heron\nLocal legend has it that a white heron with an injured leg came to these waters to heal its wound. Since then, the onsen has been called Sagi-no-yu, the \"heron hot spring.\"\nYunogo Onsen village offers both refreshing waters and the chance to walk around dressed in a kimono. On New Year's Eve you can watch a spectacular fireworks display in a scenic natural setting.\n### The darling of northern Okayama\nThere are plenty of reasons to visit the big three hot springs of northern Okayama.

Its waters are used for irrigation and drinking, and also for the nearby trout farm. A famous legend says that drinking a glass of this natural mineral water will prolong your life, so many people try to drink it.\n### Don't Miss\n- Akiyoshi-dai, one of the largest karst plateaus in Japan, and Akiyoshi-do, a large limestone cave\n- Sampling the local trout, raised in the clear waters\n## How to Get There\nBeppu Benten Pond is a short ride away from the prefectural capital of Yamaguchi City.\nTake a bus from Shin-Yamaguchi Station to Akiyoshi-do (about 40 minutes), disembark, and then take a taxi.

The traditional teahouse, Rosan-do, and the Five-Storied Pagoda make Kozan Park a fascinating and beautiful site.\nSo much to explore in Kozan Park\n### A tearoom and political hotspot—Rosan-do\nThe mid-19th century was a time of great political upheaval in Japan, leading to the end of feudalism and the establishment of prefectures. Before this area became Yamaguchi, it was known as Choshu. The former Choshu Domain lord, Mori Takachika, moved the seat of administrative power from the city of Hagi to Yamaguchi, and Rosan-do was the tearoom in his administrative residence. Many key political decisions were made here.\nStunning cherry blossoms in April\nSo green you can barely find the buildings\n### Rurikoji Temple\nRurikoji Temple is a beautiful Soto Zen temple and the heart of Kozan Park. The architecture of the wooden buildings is striking, and the temple is situated in gorgeous natural surroundings.\n### The five-storied pagoda that symbolizes Rurikoji\nThe most defining feature of Rurikoji Temple is undoubtedly the five-storied pagoda, built in 1442. It pre-dates the main temple building of Rurikoji Temple.\nThe pagoda is one of the oldest and most beautiful of its kind, often compared to the pagodas at Horyuji Temple near Nara City and Daigoji Temple in Kyoto. At the park museum, you can discover more about the pagoda and see scale models of other important pagodas from around Japan. The lighting of the pagoda at night is a striking sight as the pagoda is reflected on the pond.\n### Other area attractions to make a great day trip\nYou can combine your time at Kozan Park with visits to other locations in Yamaguchi for a wonderful day trip from Hiroshima or Fukuoka. If you spend a night in Yamaguchi, for example, you might consider Iwakuni, Shimonoseki, Hagi, and the great bridges of Tsunoshima and Kintai.\n## Keywords"}

The train is covered by the Japan Rail Pass, but the bus is not. Be aware that buses only depart Oishida Station every 60-90 minutes.\nVisitors traveling by car are required to park at a designated parking area outside the town center. Many inns offer a shuttle service into town from the lot.\n### Get to know the onsen-kyo\nPopular among Japanese travelers, the term onsen-kyo is associated with small, quaint towns and cozy inns that offer accommodation, food and hot spring bathing. As weekend retreats, they are popular with all age groups, from young families to retirees. This cherished aspect of travel in Japan often goes unnoticed by foreign visitors, so live like a local and dive into onsen-kyo culture.\nThe area is a car-free town center with no modern buildings in sight.\nHaving checked into one of the town's many inns, visitors walk the streets without the usual concern of cars zipping past to beat the traffic light.\nIn the proud tradition of Japanese inns, Ginzan Onsen's ryokan offer up sumptuous local dishes to meet the standards of their mostly Japanese clientele.\n### Such stuff as dreams are made of\nBeautiful buildings surrounded by an unspoiled rural setting ensure that Ginzan Onsen is pleasant all year round. Long summer days are perfect for lazy strolls down idyllic streets in a yukata. In winter, the town really works its magic. The sight of the buildings blanketed in snow and illuminated by the soft glow of gaslights leaves a lasting impression.\nMany Japanese visitors come to Ginzan Onsen in search of its Taisho period ambience. Anyone familiar with Mishima Yukio's novel 'Spring Snow' will delight at how the setting blends traditional Japanese aesthetics with what was once seen as modern sophistication. The gaslights and absence of motor vehicles help maintain the atmosphere.\n### The finer points of hot spring bathing\nRotenburo are outdoor baths-usually hidden from outside view-which allow you to take in the surrounding scenery from the comfort of a hot spring. Another attractive option is arranging a kashikiri session in a private bath, whereby you and traveling companions can have a tub all to yourselves for a short time.\n### Silver everything\nUnsurprisingly for a town founded on a silver mine, Ginzan Onsen takes both its name (literally, Silver Mountain) and iconography from the element. The popular Shirogane Park boasts an impressive 22 meter tall waterfall, and you'll also find an illuminated cave which is well-lit and ideal for taking pictures.\n### Old meets new meets old\nGinzan Onsen's one notable concession to modernity is the Fujiya ryokan, a striking building designed by famed architect Kuma Kengo. With a blend of modern and traditional elements, including the incorporation of bare timber and white plaster, it stands out from its surroundings while also keeping one foot firmly in the past.\n## Keywords"}

About 300 million years ago, Akiyoshidai was under the ocean, where a coral reef existed. Over a long period of time, the area was pushed up onto land. Rainwater eroded the land, forming impressive limestone and stalactite formations.\nHowever, before you explore the winding trails that run through this rocky grassland plateau, one should first visit Akiyoshido's undergound caverns, the most extensive cave system in Japan.\n### Don't Miss\n- The limestone pools and terrace inside Akiyoshido\n- The “golden pillar,” an enormous stalactite\n- The view across Akiyoshidai and the karst landscape\n## How to Get There\nAkiyoshido and Akiyoshidai are accessible via an extensive bus network from Yamaguchi City, and also from other cities throughout the prefecture.\nBocho Buses run from Shin-Yamaguchi Station to Akiyoshido Bus Center.

Two Bocho buses per day run to Akiyoshidai then on to Akiyoshido from Higashi-Hagi Station.\n### The caverns of Akiyoshido\nWalk through the trees and cross the bridge over the river into the cave known as Akiyoshido.\nThe cave is large, with a well-maintained boardwalk. Gentle lighting preserves the atmosphere of this incredible place and illuminates the stunning limestone pools, stalactites and stalagmites to great effect. The water running through the cave makes this an aural experience as well as it whittles the limestone into ever-more fantastic shapes.\nWalk above the rushing water to enter Akiyoshido\nThe limestone terrace, \"100 plates\"\n### Plates and golden pillars\nThese caves are Japan's largest, around 11 kilometers total. However, only around one kilometer is open to the public.\nThere are two very famous places inside the cavern. The first is the \"100 plates,\" a huge terrace of limestone that looks like an enormous stack of overlapping plates, all washed and ready to be used for serving customers. The other is a gigantic stalactite called the \"Golden Pillar,\" more than 15 meters tall and 4 meters in diameter.\nThere's a special trail you can climb up for an additional 300 yen that takes you higher up for a great view down into the cavern.\n### The surreal karst topography of Akiyoshidai\nAn elevator will take you up to Akiyoshidai from inside the cave. The Akiyoshidai Observatory is a five-minute walk uphill from the exit. When you step out onto the grassland, you'll have a breathtaking view of the karst.\nPampas grass was once harvested here for thatch and other uses. The annual controlled burning of the Akiyoshidai Plateau prevents trees from growing to large sizes here. Explore the this extraordinary landscape on foot along a network of walking trails. The contrast of colors—vivid green, rocky white and sky blue—will light your imagination.\n### Lighting a fire to renew the grasslands\nThe landscape of Akiyoshi-dai changes with the seasons, and once a year, people change the landscape.\nOn the third Sunday in February, a controlled burn is conducted at Akiyoshidai to conserve the grasslands. This event is called Akiyoshidai Yama-yaki. Local residents and volunteers set fire to the grasses, and the fire spreads out over the fields, turning everything black and exposing the white rocks.\nFor anyone who loves natural landscapes, Akiyoshidai and Akiyoshido are perfect for a day trip from Yamaguchi or Hagi.\n## Keywords"}

The town is surrounded by mountains and sea, and offers seasonal treats such as spring cherry blossoms, summer fireworks, and winter snow. Check Kinosaki Onsen's official website “Visit Kinosaki” for more details.\n### Don't Miss\n- Visiting the seven public bathhouses\n- Strolling in a yukata\n- Making a side trip to Onsenji Temple and the nearby mountain\n## How to Get There\nKinosaki Onsen Station is the gateway to the town, connected by the San'in Main Line to Kyoto and Osaka.\nIt takes about 2.5 hours from Kyoto or Osaka to Kinosaki Onsen Station by direct express train.\n### A riverside town\nOn either side of the Otani River are numerous Japanese inns, or ryokan, most of which have their own onsen baths.\n©Toyooka City\nThe seven public baths dotted around the town are one of the unique characteristics of Kinosaki. Visitors to the area can buy a one-day pass for 1,300 yen (as of November 2021) that allows bathing in all seven. Additionally, hot bubbling foot baths can be found in numerous locations. If you are staying at one of the town's ryokan, all of the public onsen can be accessed for free from when you check in until you check out.\n©Toyooka City\n### Slip on a yukata and stroll about town\nIt is not uncommon to see visitors to the area walking around the town in yukata—the thin cotton kimono that are closely associated with Japanese onsen towns. During the colder winter months, a warm, cotton haori jacket is worn on top of the yukata to keep out the cold.\n### The town's mysterious origins\nTowards the western end of Kinosaki Onsen is Onsenji Temple, which is dedicated to the Buddhist priest who supposedly founded Kinosaki Onsen in the 8th century. Legend has it that a priest named Douchi Shonin arrived in Kinosaki in the year 717, where he saw people suffering from incurable diseases. When he prayed for help, a white-haired man appeared to him in a dream, and suggested that he could find a hot spring. The priest believed the oracle, and chanted sutras for 1,000 days, after which hot water gushed from the ground, leading to the creation of the hot spring town.\n©Toyooka City\nOnce upon a time, visitors had to pray at the temple before they were allowed to enter the baths. While this is no longer the custom, the temple is still a great place to visit and can be combined with an enjoyable stroll through the mountains at Kinosaki's western edge.\nThe main hall of the temple can either be accessed by a short walk up the mountain or by taking the ropeway, which can take you to an observation deck at the top of the mountain.\n©Toyooka City\n### The Oriental White Stork Sanctuary\nDue to loss of habitat, the Oriental stork became extinct in Japan in 1971. The last bird actually died in Kinosaki Onsen's Toyooka City. Konotori no Sato Park was built as a research institute to protect and breed the storks, which are a National Natural Monument, and to reintroduce them to the wild. At the adjacent Stork Culture Museum, visitors can learn about efforts to reintroduce the storks, and see those used for breeding up close. The park is about 10 kilometers south of Kinosaki Onsen, and can be reached via bus from Toyooka Station.\n### Winter snow\nThe area around Kinosaki Onsen is great for activities and includes the Kannabe Kogen area. Here, visitors can enjoy climbing and hiking in summer or skiing, snowboarding and snowshoeing during winter. The town of Kinosaki receives regular snowfall and is very pretty during this season, as the river area is lined with fresh snow.\n## Keywords"}

There is nowhere more \"off-the-beaten-path\" than Shiretoko. It's a great place to connect with the simple pleasures of nature.\n### Don't Miss\n- Shiretoko National Park for Hokkaido nature at its best\n- Drift ice cruises in the winter\n- Delicious fresh seafood straight from the ocean\n- Watching rare birds\n## How to Get There\nThere are direct flights from Tokyo (both Haneda and Narita Airport) to Memanbetsu Airport and Kushiro Airport, and flights from Haneda Airport to Monbetsu Airport. For travel within Hokkaido, there are direct flights from Sapporo (New Chitose Airport) to Memanbetsu Airport and Nemuro Nakashibetsu Airport, the two closest to Shiretoko.\nLocal public transit is scarce, so it's best to see the area by car (or rental car). However, there is an overnight bus from Sapporo that takes you to the Shiretoko area's main bus terminals and hotels.\n### Pristine natural beauty at Shiretoko National Park\nShiretoko National Park is a UNESCO World Heritage Site set in the magnificent mountains and steep cliffs of the northern tip of the Shiretoko Peninsula.\nFrom spring to autumn, you can admire the serene five lakes known collectively as Shiretoko Goko, follow hiking trails to hidden waterfalls, or take a nature cruise from Utoro for the chance to see brown bears leading their cubs along the shore, as well as some of the many species of whales, dolphins, and seals that thrive in the nutrient-rich waters. In winter, take a cruise from Rausu to observe white-tailed sea eagles and Stellar's sea eagles. Or participate in a \"drift ice walk tour,\" where you wear a dry suit and walk on drift ice. The opportunity to dive under the ice floes is a unique winter experience in Shiretoko.\n### The tip of the iceberg\nThe Shiretoko area is much larger than just the national park and offers some wonderful surprises for the adventurous. Drive 50 kilometers south along the beautiful coast road from Rausu, and you will come to the entrance to Notsuke Peninsula, a long sandbar reaching out into the Nemuro Strait.\nTake a stroll to admire the dramatic landscape of sunken forests, grazing deer, wildfowl and native flowers. The imposing Kunashiri Island sits just a few miles across the waters.\nIn winter, you can see miles of drift ice floating south on the currents toward Nemuro and Cape Nosappu. Halfway between Notsuke and Nemuro is Lake Furenko, a mecca for birdwatchers. Roughly 300 species of wild birds are regular visitors here, so take all your camera gear to get some memorable snaps of Steller's sea eagles and Japanese red-crowned cranes.\n### Relaxing waters and mountain views\nHead inland and away from the choppy waters of the Nemuro Strait to get the best views of the glorious Shiretoko mountain range stretching out into the distance. Try Kaiyoudai Observatory in Nakashibetsu or Tawadaira Observatory in Shibecha for the best views.\nEnd your day with a hot soak and delicious dinner at secluded Yoroushi Onsen.\n### Rich and delicious fish\nIt's no wonder that so many bears, whales, dolphins, and birds thrive on and around the Shiretoko Peninsula. The waters are replenished annually by rich nutrients deposited by the drift ice, meaning you get to try some of the best local seafood in Japan.\nAs a starter, try some uni (sea urchin) and hokke (Atka mackerel) in Utoro and Rausu; follow up with some ikura (salmon roe), shrimp and scallop in Odaito; and there's always room for some Hanasaki crab from Nemuro and its famous sanma (Pacific saury).\n## Keywords"}

Spend half a day here and soak in the atmosphere of this bygone seat of power.\n### Don't Miss\n- Stroll through the quiet and well-kept streets of the former castle town\n- Watch a play at the Bird Theater Company\n- Enjoy the views from the ruins of Shikano Castle\n## How to Get There\nTake the Shikano-yuki Bus from Hamamura Station. Hamamura Station is on the JR Sanin Main Line.\n### The domain of a great general\nKamei Korenori, Lord of Shikano Castle, was born in Izumo Province (now part of Shimane Prefecture) in 1557. Loyal to the Amago Clan, Korenori spent the first half of his life opposed to his bitter enemies, the Mori Clan in neigboring Yamaguchi Prefecture.\nKorenori joined forces with his brother-in-law to fight the cause of the Amago Clan and achieved a short-lived victory in 1551. Korenori later joined forces with the great Japanese warlord, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who unified Japan after decades of civil war in the 16th century. Under Hideyoshi's leadership, Korenori helped take Tottori again from the Mori, and was placed in control of the Shikano area. After Hideyoshi's death, Korenori served Tokugawa Ieyasu, who became the first Tokugawa Shogun in 1603.\n### A place of exotic secrets\nKorenori became renowned as a skilled negotiator with a strong interest in foreign trade. He fought in the invasion of Korea and facilitated trade with Siam, now Thailand. Inspired by his dealings with foreign lands, he modernized his castle and made improvements to the surrounding town.\nIt is said that he changed the name of the castle to Ousha Castle, after a Buddhist center in India, and also named gun turrets after Holland and Korea. His castle was a thing of exotic beauty and this legacy can still be seen to the present day in the attractive design of the castle's moat area. Stop for a moment to feed the magnificent carp under the watchful eye of the resident swan.\nThe remains of the castle are found on top of Mt. Shiroyama. The maple-lined path leading up to the ruins is beautiful in fall, while the cherry blossom trees lining the moat are spectacular in spring.\n### A charming townscape\nIn keeping with the tradition started by their former lord, the streets of this former castle town are eye-catching and well-kept. Like other castle towns, the streets are named after the tradesmen that once plied their trade in that area. The “metal worker” and “carpenter” streets are two intersecting and authentic streets at the town's center. Koseji, an attractive temple of the Pure Land sect of Buddhism, is located near the town's visitor center.\n### A new legacy\nNext to the moat of the former castle is a new addition to the town's cultural heritage, Bird Theater. Occupying the former gymnasium of a closed-down elementary school and adjoining nursery school, the theater maintains the town's international links by hosting a festival with overseas guest performers for two weeks every year.\n## Keywords"}

The art has been thrilling local people for decades and is now regularly performed at the famous Gion Festival in Kyoto.\n### Don't Miss\n- Terrifying demons & frenzied gods\n- The eight-headed giant serpent Orochi\n- Incredible masks and costumes\n## How to Get There\nIwami Kagura is performed all-year-round in the Iwami region of Shimane Prefecture.\nShimane Prefecture is best reached from Tokyo by plane. There are direct flights from Haneda Airport to Izumo Airport and Hagi-Iwami Airport. From Izumo Airport, take the JR Sanin Line or drive to the western part of Shimane Prefecture.\nFrom Osaka, there are also direct flights to Izumo Airport. If you are traveling on the shinkansen, go from Shin-Osaka Station to Hiroshima Station and take the Isaribi Highway Bus to Hamada Station.\n### Myth and history come alive\nThe stories told in kagura dances are mostly drawn from ancient history books dating from around the eighth century, or from the legends and stories of monsters made famous in Noh theater.\nThe stories are easy to follow as they often consist of heroes and villains, gods and demons, of good guys and bad guys. Many times, these dances involve intense choreographed sword-fights. However, it's not all action and drama as there are comedic interludes with some dances that approach pantomime. These interludes are sure to have you laughing and cheering.\nThe most spectacular and unique of all the dances is the one usually performed for the finale, Yamata no Orochi, in which the hero wins the princess's hand by battling eight 17-meter long serpents with blazing eyes and sparks spewing from their open jaws. During the battle, which gets more frenzied as it develops, the eight serpents perform amazing set pieces.\n### Innovative music and costumes\nIwami Kagura is a folk art. But unlike many Japanese arts, and unlike kagura in other regions, it has not remained rigidly fixed to the forms of the past. It has continued to develop while staying true to it's roots.\nThe pounding drums and wailing flutes are played much faster in Iwami Kagura than in any other kind of kagura. Smoke-machines, wireless mics and fireworks are just some of the other innovations that local groups use to make their performances more thrilling.\nThe magnificent costumes, some worth upwards of USD $10,000, are more kabuki-esque than normal kagura costumes and have intricately embroidered three-dimensional designs that incorporate miles of gold thread and tiny mirrors. Cleverly designed to allow for instant transformations, Iwami Kagura costumes add another level of surprise to your enjoyment.\nThe masks are another Iwami innovation. Rather than being carved out of wood, Iwami Kagura uses special masks. Local makers experimented with the unusually strong sekishu washi paper produced locally and came up with a process that not only makes the masks lighter for the dancer to wear, but also allows a much greater level of detail and expression.\nThe surprisingly affordable masks are bought and displayed in the entrances to many homes and businesses to ward off evil spirits and are a popular and unique souvenir.\n### Where, when and how to see Iwami Kagura\nWith more than 130 kagura groups spread over the sparsely populated Iwami region, there is no shortage of opportunities to view this amazing spectacle. Traditionally kagura is performed as an offering to, and entertainment for, the local deities. Fortunately, what the deities enjoy and what we mere mortals enjoy turn out to be remarkably similar.\nThe best and most authentic location to see Iwami Kagura is at a local shrine festival usually held in October or November after the rice has been harvested. Continuing all night until midnight or dawn, this is the most intimate and memorable way to experience the tradition.\nIf you are here at other times of the year, Iwami Kagura is now performed at summer festivals, cherry blossom festivals, Obon dance festivals and other events and gatherings throughout the year.\nMany of the small hot spring resorts in the region like Yunotsu or Arifuku put on short performances, usually on a Saturday night, to introduce Iwami Kagura to their guests.\nMost towns in the region hold annual kagura competitions where several groups are invited to perform dances. Competition between groups is fierce and local audiences are knowledgeable and critical, so great effort is made to put on a winning performance. Held in auditoriums and large halls, these competitions give you the chance to see a wide variety of dances and different styles in one place.\n## Keywords"}

In addition to the Atomic Bomb Dome World Heritage site, the park is home to the Cenotaph for the Atomic Bomb Victims, where the names of all those who lost their lives are inscribed, and several other memorials.\nThe Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum dedicated to documenting the reality of the nuclear bombing, attracts more than 1.7 million visitors a year from Japan and abroad.\n### Quick Facts\nHiroshima Peace Memorial Park covers an area of 122,100 sq. m.\nThe park is home to many memorials and monuments, including the Cenotaph for the A-Bomb Victims, the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum, the Hiroshima National Peace Memorial Hall for the Atomic Bomb Victims and more\n## How to Get There\nFrom JR Hiroshima Station, take the Hiroshima Electric Railway (Hiroden) streetcar (No. 2 or 6), get off at the \"Genbaku Dome-mae\" stop, and walk for 1 minute. The total travel time is 17 minutes.\n### The Atomic Bomb Dome\nThe Atomic Bomb Dome, formerly the Hiroshima Prefectural Industrial Promotion Hall, was designed by Czech architect Jan Letzl. It was highly acclaimed at the time of its construction in 1915 for its bold European design. At 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945, the building was destroyed by the world's first atomic bomb dropping, and it burned to the ground. It was instantly engulfed in flames, from the ceiling to the ground, instantly killing everyone in the building. Because the pressure of the blast came from above, part of the wall escaped collapse.\nIt was called the \"Atomic Bomb Dome\" for its distinctive domed steel frame and was included in UNESCO's World Heritage List in December 1996 as a symbol of the devastation caused by the first atomic bomb in the history of humankind. It represents the importance of the abolition of nuclear weapons and lasting world peace.\n### Nearby monuments and memorials\nThe Cenotaph for the Atomic Bomb Victims (officially the Memorial Monument for Hiroshima, City of Peace) is where the list of names of those who perished in during the atomic bombing is inscribed. It is made of stone and shaped like an arched, gable roof to protect the souls of the atomic bomb victims from the rain and dew.\nThe Hiroshima Peace Park Rest House, located 170 meters from the hypocenter, burned down during the atomic bombing but was reconstructed after the war. It reopened in July 2020. The first floor is a tourist information center with local products for sale. The second floor is a rest area with a coffee shop, and the basement and third floor are used for exhibition.\nThe Peace Bell was created as a symbol of the spiritual and cultural movement to achieve a world of peaceful coexistence, free of nuclear weapons and war. The surface of the bell is embossed with a map of the world without borders, symbolizing \"One World.\"\nThe many children who perished during the atomic bombing, including Sadoko Sasaki, who died of leukemia, are memorialized at the Children's Peace Monument. The statue was erected by Sadako's classmates, who raised funds to build this memorial for a world without nuclear weapons.\nThe Flame of Peace has burned continually since it was lit on August 1, 1964. It symbolizes the anti-nuclear commitment to \"keep the flame burning until the day when all nuclear weapons have disappeared from the earth.\" The pedestal represents two hands with palms open towards the sky.\n## Keywords"}

It's believed to be around 1,200 years old and once served as a place of ascetic training for monks. It is for this reason that it is registered as an Important Cultural Property of Japan.\n### An essential Buddhist divinity\nInside the temple is a statue of the Buddhist deity, Fudo Myoo. As one of the Five Wisdom Kings, Fudo Myoo is one of the most important Buddhist divinities. The statue is said to be one of three Fudo Myoo statues carved by the founder of Shingon Buddhism on Koyasan, Kobo Daishi (774-835).\n### A Shugendo place of worship\nFudo Myoo is considered the main deity of Shugendo, a religion that combines elements of esoteric Buddhism, Shintoism, and Shamanism. With this in mind, coupled with the fact that Fudoin Iwayado Temple has striking similarities to the Shugendo temple of Nageiredo at Mt. Mitoku, it can be surmised that this was also a Shugendo place of worship.\n### Viewing Fudo Myoo\nIt is possible to view the statue twice a year, when the temple is opened to the public in special ceremonies, held on March 28 and July 28.\nThe latest information may differ, so please check the official website.\n## Keywords"}

Sanbe, erupted violently. The surrounding area was buried under volcanic ash and debris, destroying all life. Due to its topography, this little valley was buried more slowly, which is why many of the trees remained standing.\nThis buried forest was accidentally discovered in 1983.

Each individual onsen resort has many modern and well-equipped hot spring baths as well as ryokan, where you can enjoy bathing facilities and stay as an overnight guest.\n### Don't Miss\n- The helpful list of public baths at Beppu Station's Tourist Information Center\n- Bathing in naturally hot sand at the Beppu Beach Sand Bath\n- Bathing in a muddy hot water bath at Myoban Onsen\n## How to Get There\nBeppu Station can be reached by limited express train from Hakata, Oita, Miyazaki, and Hitoyoshi, as well as neighboring areas.\nAll of the eight areas can be reached from Beppu Station by public transport. The closest one, Ekimae-koto Onsen, is a two-minute walk from the station, while the furthest one, Shibaseki Onsen, is about a 30-minute bus ride.\n### Soaked in history\nAccording to legend, the hot spring water in the area was first used by the gods Sukunabikona and Okuninushi in the 8th century. The pair visited Iyo-no-Kuni, which is now known as Ehime Prefecture. While visiting the area, Sukunabikona fainted from illness. To cure him, Okuninushi piped water from Beppu Onsen to the ancient Dogo Onsen, which miraculously cured Sukunabikona.\n### The bath of samurai\nLater, in the Kamakura Period (1185-1333), wounded samurai bathed in Beppu Onsen to help speed recovery. Today, locals and tourists alike journey to the area to soak, for relaxation of the body and mind.\n### The perfect water for all types\nHot spring water varieties range from those high in chloride to those high in sodium bicarbonate. Many of the baths are claimed to be beneficial for illnesses like neuralgia, rheumatism, and fatigue. You can also try drinking the spring water at some hot springs (please check with staff beforehand), which is said to help gastroenteritis, diabetes, and gout.\n### Record-breaking onsen hub\nThere are close to 3,000 hot spring sources in Beppu City, representing more than 10% of all vents in Japan. Beppu City boasts the largest volume of hot spring water in Japan.\n### Onsen highlights\nBe sure to visit Ekimae-koto Onsen, the closest hot spring resort to Beppu Station. A bath shrouded in nostalgia, this onsen and ryokan looks like a classic European villa from the outside.\n### Step back in time\nWhen in the area you have to visit Hamawaki Onsen, the origin point of the Beppu Onsen district. Surrounded by rustic buildings and friendly locals, this laid back pocket of Beppu feels like time has stopped.\n### Getting dirty\nThe famous mud bath and the milky baths are on offer for those adventurous types wanting to get a little more out of their onsen experience. The spacious open-air bath is mixed in terms of gender, but the white, smooth mud is said to do therapeutic wonders for your skin.\n## Keywords"}

The sweeping grasslands of the area are scattered with white limestone mounds and conical sinkholes. The Karst extends along rolling mountains and has multiple trails with expansive panoramas of the Shikoku region and the Pacific Ocean.\n### Don't Miss\n- The mossy trails and ancient trees of Keyakidaira\n- Other-worldly stargazing opportunities\n- Scenic hikes and stunning seasonal blooms\n## How to Get There\nHard to reach by public transport and therefore suited to intrepid travelers, this pristine natural hideout can be accessed by car from Kochi and Matsuyama or a combination of taxi, bus and train travel from Kochi Station.\nIf you choose to rent a car, the scenic drive from either Kochi or Matsuyama takes around two hours. The journey by public transport and taxi requires a number of changes.\nTo get there via public transport, depart from Kochi Station and arrive at Susaki Station to catch a bus towards Yusuhara. Change again at Shinden and take a taxi to Hoshifuru Village Tengu (formerly Tenguso), in the middle of the Karst. During the winter months, some areas of the Karst become inaccessible due to snow.\n### Quick Facts\nThe area is split into three parts; the Tengu Highland, Keyakidaira and Mezurudaira\nThe karst has an elevation of 1,400 meters\nThe area straddles both Ehime and Kochi prefectures\n### A place for all seasons\nThe Shikoku Karst transitions seamlessly with the seasons. Spring sees the grasses turn a vibrant hue of green. On hikes through the area in summer, you can see lilies all around. Old man of the mountain and forget-me-nots also dot the hillsides.\nRich, vibrant leaves cover the trees during fall months, whilst the grass turns a striking shade of silver. Then in the winter, you may find a dusting of the purest white snow covering the hillsides.\n### Forest bathing\nThe hiking trail in the Tengu Highlands that passes through Tengu Forest is a great way to soak up the area's incredible beauty. Look out for the Japanese cypress wood-chip paths meandering through the forest, which are surrounded by stunning white birch and red pine trees.\nThe walk takes approximately three hours and at the end of it, you are rewarded with fantastic views of the Shikoku mountains and on a clear day, the Pacific Ocean.\n### The great outdoors\nDuring summer months, camping is the perfect way to immerse yourself in the tranquil atmosphere of the Karst. The Mezurudaira area has plenty of campsites where you'll find pastoral scenes of cows lazily grazing. The Karst is so far from any major cities there is little to no light pollution, making it the perfect spot to stargaze.\n### A riot of color\nThe nearby Ogawamine area includes several notable mountains. Kasatori, Ogawamine, Mikawamine, and Ubahodo all reach heights of between 900 and 1,500 meters. In spring, the mountains are carpeted with the bold magenta rhododendron flowers. On a clear day, you can see Mt. Ishizuchi and the Sata Peninsula nearby.\n### Warm hospitality\nIn the midst of the Karst's Highlands sits the Hoshifuru Village Tengu (formerly Tenguso) and Mezuruso Cottages. Taste the flavors of the mountains, such as pheasant and wild boar served alongside the best of seasonal produce.\nHoshifuru Village Tengu has a large bath which looks over the Pacific and the Ishizuchi mountains, and is the perfect place to unwind after a long day of hiking. At Mezuruso, try amago, a red spotted masu trout from the nearby rivers of Kumakogen, cooked on an outdoor charcoal fire. Both accommodations also have campsites.\n### Starlight, waterfalls and fairytale villages\nMuch like Shirakawa-go, the thatched farmhouse village of Kumakogen Furusato Ryoko Mura could have been lifted from a fairytale. The planetarium and observatory offer unimpeded views of the twinkling night skies. Nearby, Omogo Gorge and Goraiko and Gongen waterfalls draw visitors with their clear rippling waters and dense surrounding forest.\n## Keywords"}

One look and you'll see why. On a typically sunny day, the azure sea and the small islands floating on the horizon present just the kind of romantic, idyllic getaway travelers seek.\nCross the bridge by car to explore the island of Tsunoshima, including the resort there, Cobalt Blue Beach, and one of the oldest Western-style lighthouses in Japan. Tsunoshima may be a little out of the way, but it's well worth the effort to get there.\n### Don't Miss\n- Tsunoshima Lighthouse, built in 1876\n- The island resort area and Cobalt Blue Beach\n- The view across the bridge from Amagase Park\n## How to Get There\nYou can reach the Shimonoseki area via plane, train and bus.\nFly from Haneda Airport in Tokyo to Yamaguchi's Ube Airport, then take the airportshare taxi to Shimonoseki Station (1 hour 15 minutes).

Tsunoshima itself is covered in trees and has few houses, giving it a secluded atmosphere, and the resorts here are just as appealing. You can camp on the island as well as Tsunoshima Ohama Campground.\nOnce you reach Tsunoshima Lighthouse, you'll find a carpark and several shops selling local souvenirs, along with cafes and public toilets. Locally caught grilled squid is just one of the local specialties offering an authentic taste of coastal life.\n### A lighthouse popular with couples\nThe Meiji Government commissioned British architect Richard Henry Brunton to construct the Tsunoshima Lighthouse. The structure is open to the public and is a popular spot for couples. Part of the building's appeal may be seen in how its white walls stand out against the blue summer skies.\nYou can climb the narrow, winding stairs inside the lighthouse for a small fee. From the top, step out into the open air to gaze out across Tsunoshima and beyond. You can see the large lighthouse lens and displays that describe its construction at the neighboring museum.\n### Other sites around Tsunoshima\nCombine your trip to Tsunoshima with a stop at Motonosumi Inari Shine, 40 minutes to the north, famous for its 123 vermilion torii gates. The site is reminiscent of the more famous Inari Shrine in Kyoto, but the torii gates here include views of the Sea of Japan, the rocky coast, and waves crashing against the rocks.\nWith all these scenic wonders and none of the crowds of Kyoto, this location may prove more appealing than its more famous counterpart.\n## Keywords"}

Nowadays the area is famed for its preserved historical townscape; the area's main streetway is lined by traditional wooden buildings harking back to the Edo period (1603-1867). Known as the town facing the Seto Inland Sea, visit Takehara, to round out your Hiroshima area experience.\n### Don't Miss\n- “Takehara Lattice,” paper-art like panel lattice adorning many of the traditional wooden buildings\n- Experiencing traditional bamboo crafts at the Machinami Bamboo Studio\n- Tasting sake at the Fujii Shuzo Sake and Souvenir Store\n## How to Get There\nTakehara is best reached by train or a combination of train and bus travel modes from Hiroshima. Reach Hiroshima from Tokyo or Osaka via bullet train.\nHighway buses run directly to Takehara Station from the Hiroshimaeki Bus Stop at the train station; the journey takes around one hour and 10 minutes.\nIf traveling via train to Takehara Station from Hiroshima, take either bullet or regular trains to Mihara Station. Transfer for the JR Kure Line for Hiro and disembark at Takehara Station.\nAlternatively, take the Akiji-Liner for Hiro from Hiroshima Station. When you reach Hiro, change for the JR Kure Line for Mihara, and disembark at Takehara Station.\nThe preserved townscape area is about 12 minutes from the station by foot.\n### A must for sake lovers\nWhile Takehara has ceded its sake making crown to the nearby sake district of Saijo, visit Fujii Sake Brewery, one of the few remaining sake brewers located within the historically preserved area. The producer uses traditional methods and locally grown rice and spring water to produce its award-winning brews.\nFor those interested in the history of Japanese alcohol, Masataka Taketsuru, founder of Nikka whisky, was born in Takehara in 1894. After leaving his family sake brewery, he traveled to Scotland, married a Scottish woman and came back to Japan to found the company. Sake is still beloved and brewed by many in his hometown.\n### Festivals of light and shadow\nSeveral colorful festivals are held throughout the year, but Takehara really embraces the all things celebratory during summer. Takehara's biggest event is the \"Takehara Longing Road,\" in which the town's historic district is lit up with the light of 5,000 bamboo lanterns. More than 30,000 people visit the event every year.\nDuring Obon, the annual Buddhist event for commemorating one's ancestors, August's Sumiyoshi Festival sees women in kimono dancing through the evening streets and lit paper lanterns floating on the bay.\n### Nearby natural hot springs\nThere are some spots nearby to enjoy natural hot springs, but perhaps the most memorable is Enmei no Yu at Kamogawaso. In addition, Yusaka Onsenkyo has a Japanese garden and is a popular area for tourists.\n### A view worth walking for\nA single train stop east of Takehara Station will take you to Mt. Kurotaki, which stands 266 tall meters and takes around 45 minutes to climb. The summit offers spectacular views of the city and the surrounding Seto Inland Sea.\nThirty-three Buddhist stone statues line the mountain path. The statues were donated by the locals over 150 years ago to watch over you as you hike up the slope.\n## Keywords"}

While many visitors come to visit these cute critters, they may not realize the island harbors a terrifying secret.\n### Don't Miss\n- Southwest of the beach resort is the Hill of the Evening Sun, a great spot to see the sunset\n- Look for the picturesque lighthouse on the southern tip of the island (off-limits)\n- The island also has Japan's tallest electricity pylon, 226 meters high\n## How to Get There\nOkunoshima is accessible by ferry from Tadanoumi.\nFrom the mainland, you can take a ferry from Tadanoumi, on the JR Kure Line. Another ferry to the island leaves from Omishima.\n### Fluffy bunnies everywhere\nThere is no way of knowing exactly how many rabbits currently live on the island, but with no natural predators and cats and dogs barred from entry, the numbers will continue to grow.\nThere are conflicting stories as to where the rabbits came from. Some believe they are descended from a small batch of eight rabbits released by school children in 1971, while others say the original rabbits were test subjects released after World War II. Either way, they are now the island's biggest draw, and they are very well cared for.\nGuests to the island are encouraged to buy food and feed these docile creatures, who are so used to human contact at this point that they are all but domesticated. Just be ready to run when you run out of food, as they are prone to chase.\n### Other Attractions\nThe island has many beautiful beaches to enjoy, and there are campgrounds. But no matter where you go, the rabbits are a constant factor, adding a healthy serving of cuteness to almost anything you can do on the island.\n### A Dark History\nWhile the island is a very popular tourist spot, it does have a tragic past. The island does not shy away from its history, even exploring it for the sake of a brighter future. So even if you are not an animal lover, but are rather a history buff, Okunoshima is still well worth a visit.\nAlthough Japan was a signatory to the 1925 Geneva Protocol prohibiting chemical warfare, just four years later in 1929, a secret chemical weapons factory was built on Okunoshima. By the end of World War II, mustard gas and tear gas were being made at this one factory.\nIsolated yet still relatively accessible, Okunoshima was the perfect location for these secret activities. At the time, the government went to great lengths to keep the factory a secret, even removing the island from some maps and keeping the locals in the dark as to what was being produced.\nAs the war ended, documents were destroyed and the Allied forces disposed of the stockpiled chemicals. It was only decades later that the government admitted to any wrongdoing and offered financial and medical support to those in the area whose health had been damaged by the factory.\n### A museum of sadness\nIn 1988, a museum was opened on Okunoshima to present the island's secret past of poison gas manufacturing in unflinching detail.

Although it has been rebuilt several times due to disasters, it still retains the appearance of the shrine built by Taira no Kiyomori, a famous military leader of the late Heian period (794-1185).

It is said that the people of the time considered the island awe-inspiring, so they built a shrine in a place where the tide ebbed and flowed to avoid damaging the sacred “body” of the island.\n### The offshore Otorii gate\nThe Otorii was built offshore from the shrine in 1875, and was the original entrance to the shrine. Worshippers would pass beneath the gate by boat on their way to Itsukushima Shrine.\n### A beautiful journey on the water\nThe ferry ride to the island offers views of Itsukushima Shrine from the calm sea, with Mt. Misen towering behind it. Ferries operate from morning to night.\n### Approaching the Otorii\nAt high tide, Itsukushima Shrine and the Otorii appear to float on the water, while at low tide the shrine's foundation and mud flats are exposed. At that time you can walk up to the Otorii gate, making for a great photo opportunity.\n### Mt. Misen, a World Heritage Site\nIn addition to its cultural and spiritual significance, Miyajima was registered as a World Cultural Heritage Site in 1996 in recognition of the primeval forests of Mt. Misen. There are numerous megaliths along the mountain trail and at the summit. From the top, you can see the beauty of the many islands dotting the Seto Inland Sea when conditions are clear.\n## Keywords"}

But the town isn't just a place to escape the grind of modern life. It has a compelling history as a strategic location on the Seto Inland Sea, which made it a vital connection point for trade routes.\n### Don't Miss\n- Swimming and marine activities at Ushimado Beach\n- Japan's largest olive orchard and its famous olive soft serve\n- Islands to explore in the Seto Inland Sea\n- Exploring the old town's history\n## How to Get There\nTake the Ako Line from Okayama Station to Oku Station. It takes about 25 minutes. From there, catch the bus bound for Ushimado.\n### Lazy days at a seaside resort town\nUshimado is the quintessential seaside resort town. Its pretty coastline is dotted with small islands and beautiful beaches.\nActivities like canoeing, kayaking, sailing and swimming can be enjoyed year-round. There are kayaking schools offering lessons for all levels. Check at the Momotaro Tourist Information Center near Okayama Station for more information on activities and tours.\nAlthough there are several beaches in the town, Ushimado Beach gets the most traffic. During summer daytimes, beachfront shops sell snacks, drinks, and light meals, along with inflatables of all shapes and sizes.\nAt low tide, three nearby islands become part of the mainland. A sandbar emerges from the water, revealing the Kuroshima Venus Road, a romantic way to visit the islands.\n### Escape to a hilltop shrine\nA few meters away from the sands of Ushimado Beach are steep stone steps which lead to Ushimado-jinja Shrine. The shrine, located at the top of the hill, is shaded by tall cedar trees, making it cooler than the beachfront.\n### Visit an island by ferry\nA five-minute ferry takes you from the beach to Maejima Island. It's a relaxing trip worth taking for the scenery alone. Fishing is the most popular activity on the island, which is known for its delicious oysters.\nThe island's main thoroughfare is a great place for cycling, with rental facilities where you can pick up a bicycle.\nYou can spend the night on one of the island's bed and breakfasts.\n### Harbor life\nThe local yacht harbor hosts regular events, including small music festivals and an annual regatta. There is a cafe perfectly situated with a great view of the Seto Inland Sea, for meals and oceanfront refreshments.\n### Summer festivities\nEvery August there is a summer festival in Ushimado that includes an hour-long fireworks show. People come from far and wide to participate, with crowds that rival similar events held in Okayama City. That's quite an achievement for a town of only around 7,000.\n### A trip to the Mediterranean\nAnother popular spot in Ushimado is the Olive Garden. This olive orchard is the largest in Japan, home to thousands of olive trees and designed to give visitors a taste of the Mediterranean. A few sculptures, including the Three Graces Square on Roman Hill, help to create this feeling.\nThe Olive Garden offers more than just olives. It has magnificent views of the Seto Inland Sea from its rolling hills and is a popular spot from which paragliders can take flight.\nThe Olive Garden is particularly famous for its olive soft serve. It's an even bigger hit than the cooking oil, health products and olive oil cosmetics available at the orchard shop.\n### Get in touch with the area's history\nMake time for a stroll through the old part of the town, where you can explore exquisite Japanese architecture, from elegant merchant homes to repurposed public buildings.\nOne is the Kaiyukan, which was once the local police station. The Western-influenced building is now a museum dedicated to telling the story of a Korean mission that passed through town several hundred years ago. In fact, there is an annual celebration of the occasion that includes a re-enactment by local residents.\n## Keywords"}

Japanese artists are also well represented, with works by Fujishima Takeji, Aoki Shigeru, and Munakata Shiko.\n### From cotton mill to contemporary restaurant complex\nMake sure to visit Ivy Square, a Western-style hotel and restaurant complex. Built of bricks, but covered entirely in ivy, the site was the first cotton mill in Japan, built in 1889.\n### Still waters that run deep\nThe willow-lined Kurashiki River flows through the historical quarter and, if you like, you can even take a short guided boat ride on it. A romantic but also an informative way to gain insight into Kurashiki, purchase tickets from the tourist information center in the old city hall building.\n### Souvenirs and other sundries\nSeveral shops in Kurashiki specialize in Kojima denim, as the area is a center for Japanese indigo dye production and the birthplace of Japanese denim. With everything available from jeans to jean suits to denim kimono, you can also purchase all manner of indigo textiles and handcrafted items.\nAlso famous is Kurashiki brand sake, available directly from breweries and retail outlets. Wine from the Funao district and locally produced delicacies such as sweet rice cakes and rice dumplings offer a few more souvenir possibilities.\n## Keywords"}

Between March and mid-April, the plum grove of 100 trees welcomes spring with soft shades of white and pink.\nDuring the summer, you will see the Japanese iris garden that comes into full bloom in early June, with colors of white and purple. This blanket of color is broken with an artfully inserted wooden bridge that zigzags over a stream.\n### Four seasons of colors and scents\nSummer also brings the opportunity to visit the park during the early evening hours. The garden is lit with beautifully carved bamboo lanterns that sprout out of the ground. The lanterns guide you throughout the garden, where you can to see the trees, flowers, and creatures of the garden in a very different light.\nYou can visit Korakuen during full moons from August to October. The fall season brings a rich palette of reds, oranges, browns, and yellows that are acutely realized in the Chishio-no-mori Grove.

The size of the castle and its majestic location next to the river make it a grand place to visit.\nWhile you can walk around the Korakuen Garden in a couple of hours, it is worthy of a more lengthy, leisurely stay, with time to take in the sights, scents and sounds.\n## Keywords"}

The World Heritage site also includes Omori, the picturesque small town that administered and serviced the mines, and two ports on the coast, Yunotsu and Maji, which served as the transit points where the silver was shipped out and supplies came in.\n### Don't Miss\n- The World Heritage Center where you can learn everything about the area\n- Temples such as Rakanji\n- Beautiful walking paths\n## How to Get There\nYou can reach Iwami Ginzan via train and bus from Izumo and Matsue.\nTrains run from Matsue and Izumo stations to Odashi Station. The most common route to the site is from Odashi Station on the main Sanin Line, 25 minutes away. Other, less frequent buses come from Iwami-Kawamoto Station on the Sanko Line, just 35 minutes away. The Iwami Ginzan bus stop is at the World Heritage Center, where all the buses stop. Odashi Station is 50 minutes from Matsue.\n### Quick Facts\nWhen production of the mine was at its peak in the 16th and 17th centuries, it produced a third of the world's silver\nAt one time a quarter of a million people worked at or in support of the mine\n### Getting a handle on the area\nGet oriented at the new World Heritage Center to figure out what you want to see and how to navigate the area. The World Heritage Center is also where the buses arrive. Much of the World Heritage site is not accessible to vehicles, so shuttle buses will take you to the different spots where you can start exploring.\nThe displays in this big, new museum are varied and cover many different aspects of the mine, including the history, the science, the engineering, and the life of the people. The staff at the reception area can give you a printed handout in English or you can borrow an iPad to read and hear descriptions of what you are seeing.\n### Explore the town that served the mine\nA shuttle bus runs from the center to both the top and bottom of Omori. A quiet footpath heads up the left side of the valley through woodlands and past stone stairways that ascend the mountainside to where there were once many temples. Life as a miner was brutal and short, and many temples were needed to provide funeral services.\nBefore heading up the valley, stop in at Rakanji. Just across the road three small stone bridges take you to a series of caves dug into the rock face by the miners that contain 500 statues of rakan, the disciples of the Buddha, every one of which has quite a different pose and expression.\n### Walking the silver roads\nThe two walking routes along the old roads that connected the mine to the sea ports are the eight-kilometer route to Tomogaura near Maji Station and the 12-kilometer route to Okidomari near Yunotsu. Of the two, the Okidomari route is the best developed as it is part of the Chugoku Nature Trail, but as Yunotsu and Maji are connected by train it would be feasible to do the complete circle in a day if you're up for the exercise.\n### A place to soothe your tired feet\nThe hot spring resort of Yunotsu, also part of the World Heritage sites, is a popular place to stay. You could leave from there, take the route passing through the beautiful and serene countryside before climbing up to the pass and dropping down to the mine area and then to Omori.\nAlternatively, you could start your visit at Omori, head up to the mine and then carry on up and over the mountain before the long descent down to Yunotsu.\n## Keywords"}

You'll learn about the history of the 400-year-old castle and the town that formed around it.\nA good place to begin your explorations of Matsue is the large international visitor center.\n### Don't Miss\n- Trying some traditional wagashi sweets, a local specialty\n- The reconstructed 400-year-old teahouse\n- The traditional garden with Matsue Castle appearing in the background\n## How to Get There\nYou can take a sightseeing bus to the museum.\nThe very convenient Lakeline Sightseeing Bus stops directly in front of the entrance, which is halfway between the main castle entrance and Shiomi Nawate Street.\n### Tea and history\nA free audio guide in English will help you with understanding the exhibits of the permanent collection, which focuses on the castle and life in the castle town, but also emphasizes the tea ceremony. This focus is due to the Matsudaira lords, who made Matsue a major center for this elegant art.\nA 400-year-old teahouse has been reconstructed within the museum. You can enjoy your matcha green tea with wagashi, traditional sweets, while looking out on a karesansui-style Japanese garden that incorporates a view of the castle in its scenery.\n### The art of confectionery\nWhile you are choosing your sweets from the wide variety of colorful, miniature works of art offered, watch the confectioner at work crafting and sculpting these Matsue specialties.\nThe museum puts on a variety of demonstrations and offers workshops in traditional arts and crafts.\n### One of the three great boat festivals of Japan\nEntry into the museum also gives you entry into the much smaller Horan-enya Memorial Hall next door. Every inch of space is packed with displays, videos, models, and photos of the colorful three-day festival that takes place only once every 10 years (next in 2029), and which is one of the three great boat festivals of Japan.\nThe festival begins at Jozan Inari-jinja Shrine, just across the moat, and travels down the Ohashi River to Adakaya-jinja Shrine, just off the Nakaumi Lagoon.\n## Keywords"}

The Sunrise Izumo night train from Tokyo offers a nice alternative, and there are night buses as well. Multiple flights from Tokyo to nearby airports arrive daily.\nThe castle is just two kilometers from Matsue Station, and numerous buses pass the castle entrance. The most convenient is the Kurutto Matsue Lakeline Bus, with its one-day pass that enables you to cheaply and easily visit many of this castle town's sights.\n### Plover Castle\nThe second largest of the surviving original castles in Japan is also known as the Plover Castle because of its shape and black exterior. Its construction was finished in 1611 after it was decided to move the domain capital to this spot.\nThe Matsudaira family, direct descendants of the shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu (1543-1616), ruled the castle for most of its history, and the seventh lord, Matsudaira Harusato (known as Lord Fumai), a great exponent of the tea ceremony, was responsible for making Matsue one of the three great centers of the art of tea.\nAs you explore the different floors of the castle's interior, while walking on dark wooden floors and stairs worn smooth over the centuries, you can view the only existing castle keep with a well inside, built in a unique architecture style. You can see the complex architecture of this wooden fortress's construction up close.\nFrom the top floor you have a 360-degree view over the town that formed around the castle and as far as Lake Shinji.\n### The Park around the castle\nThe extensive grounds of the castle is now called Jozan Park, and is free to enter. Many paths go around under the steep stone walls of the castle, the wooded hillsides, and along the moats, making for some quiet pleasant walks. In the spring this is a popular spot for cherry blossom viewing.\nThere are three shrines within the park, but the one worth seeking out is down a quiet lane to the rear of the castle. Jozan Inari-jinja Shrine was the favorite shrine of writer Lafcadio Hearn, whose home was a stone's throw away across the moat. Explore behind the buildings and discover hundreds of small statues of kitsune, the fox messengers of the deity Inari enshrined here.\n### A chronicle of a rare event\nJozan Inari-jinja Shrine is the start and endpoint of the Horan-enya Festival, a three-day event involving decorated boats filled with musicians and dancers that is one of the three great boat festivals of Japan. Taking place only every 10 years, the next will be in 2029, but at the nearby Horanenya Museum you can find out all about it and watch videos of this event which fills the city with visitors.\n### A mansion built for an emperor\nAlso within the castle grounds is the Kounkaku, a magnificent Western-style mansion built of wood, constructed in 1903 for the Meiji Emperor to stay if he came to Matsue on one of his many tours of the country. He never did come, but his son, the Crown Prince Yoshihito, later the Taisho Emperor, did spend three days here in 1907.\nThe first floor has exhibitions on Matsue history, and on the second floor the elegant rooms have the original furnishings and décor fit for royalty.\n### Take a slow cruise to get an unusual perspective\nAfter your visit to the castle, or even before, take a leisurely cruise around the moat and surrounding canals in small boats from which you see the castle from all angles as well as the nearby samurai district of Shiomi Nawate Street.\nThe boats can be boarded at several spots and a free audio guide will explain the history of the sights you see. The boats have roofs to protect passengers from the rain, and in winter kotatsu heaters and blankets will keep you warm.\n### Special events of note\nFrom October, the castle is illuminated at night, and throughout the month thousands of paper lanterns line the moat and castle grounds. The Horikawa boats themselves are illuminated, and run special evening cruises during this period.\nOn the third sunday of October, a unique drum festival starts at the castle. Huge taiko drums with a diameter of about two meters are pulled through the streets and everyone, visitors included, is encouraged to join in\n## Keywords"}

The ancient 48-metre-high main building has been reconstructed at 1/10th scale.\nIn the foyer of the museum, you will see the base of the uzubashira, three pillars together to form a huge pillar 3-meters in diameter, that supported the shrine.\n### The 358 bronze swords\nThe most magnificent display is the 358 bronze swords unearthed at Kojindani, where it is believed they were buried as part of religious ritual.\nGleaming reconstructions are displayed alongside real bronze swords. More swords were found buried at this one site in Izumo than in all of the rest of Japan combined. Fifteen kilometers away, at Kojindani, is a small museum and a park where you can learn more about this fascinating find.\n### Surrounding attractions\nNear JR Izumoshi Station about 12 km away, Izumoyayoi no Mori is a new museum dedicated to the Yayoi period and its tombs, which offers in-depth insights into the Yayoi period and the uniquely shaped tombs of Izumo.\n## Keywords"}

Daisen大山\nSaihaku-gun, Tottori-ken\n## A mountain paradise for outdoor sports enthusiasts\nPopular with hikers and a top ski destination, Mt. Daisen is considered one of the most awe-inspiring places in western Japan. The mountain's form and surrounding unspoiled beech forests see it rival Mt. Fuji.\n### Don't Miss\n- Gorgeous hiking trails\n- One of western Japan's most popular ski resorts\n## How to Get There\nMt. Daisen is accessible by bus from Yonago Station.\nLocal buses operate on average five times a day between Yonago Station and Mt. Daisen. A loop bus runs from Yonago Station to Mt. Daisen's main tourism spots during the peak season, and on weekends and holidays.\n### Quick Facts\nThe mountain is 1,729 meters high\nIts name means “Great Mountain” and it is said to be the abode of the God of Fire\n### A mini Mt. Fuji\nA survey by national public broadcaster NHK ranked Mt. Daisen third in a league table of Japan's greatest summits, just behind Mt. Fuji, the country's tallest peak, and Mt. Yarigatake, in the Japan Alps.\nWhile the cultural importance and iconic nature of Mt. Fuji can never be overstated, Mt. Daisen has won praise as the highest mountain in the Chugoku region, and as a spiritual symbol.\nWith far fewer visitors than Mt. Fuji, as well as stunning views and a rich history, Mt. Daisen offers for many a more rewarding and personally enriching trip.\n### Spectacular hiking trails\nMt. Daisen is crisscrossed by a network of hiking trails that vary in distance and difficulty. Basic maps and hiking tips are available at the Daisen Information Center for the more popular and easier-to-navigate courses. Do engage a local guide if you wish to try one of the more adventurous or remote trails.\n### Heady peaks\nIts highest peak, Kengamine, at 1,729 meters, is unstable and on the verge of collapse after an earthquake that struck Tottori Prefecture in 2000, and access is strictly forbidden.\nHowever, you may summit the mountain's second highest point Misen, which at 1,709 meters offers unparalleled views of the Sea of Japan and Miho Bay on one side, and the peaks of the Chugoku mountain range on the other.\n### Bask in the scenery\nThe Natsuyama hiking course is a good choice for amateur climbers, although it can get busy. The course will take you through beech forests and patches of yew to the top of the Misen peak.\nIf you go in summer, expect to see some of Japan's most beautiful wildflowers. Autumn brings beautiful foliage in shades of red and orange.\nOn your way down, you may wish to take the slightly longer loop route for a change in scenery.\nThis will take you across a stony river plain, through the woods to Ogamiyama-jinja Shrine, and then down a cobbled ancient road to historic Daisenji Temple, which was founded in 718.\nA round trip may take between three and five hours, but do allow some buffer time if you intend to take the longer route down.\n### Alternative trails\nOther trails include the Utopia course, which is slightly more challenging but offers a quieter way up to a mountain lodge called the Utopia Hut. Allow six hours for a round trip.\nThe popular Daisendaki Waterfall hiking course takes you through pristine unspolit forests to a scenic two-tiered waterfall.\n### Snow sports\nMt. Daisen is one of western Japan's top ski destinations and a popular playground for locals and city dwellers alike.\nWith spectacular views of the ocean, several miles of manicured slopes and abundance of quality snow, Mt. Daisen is a veritable winter wonderland.\nThe Daisen White Resort offers everything from black diamond ski runs to beginner practice slopes.\nThere are snowshoeing tours through the pristine forests and along ridges, with a number of companies offering packages. More details can be obtained at the information center.\n### Sacred isolation\nMt. Daisen, which means “Great Mountain\", has been worshipped for millennia.\nIt was formerly known as Ogamiyama, which translates as “Mountain of the Great God”. The God was believed by many to be the Kagutsuchi-no-mikoto, or God of Fire.\nThe holy mountain was an important training site for mountain ascetics and access was strictly restricted until the late 19th century. As a result of this isolation, beech forests were able to grow undisturbed.\n## Keywords"}

Mitoku三徳山\nMisasa-cho, Tottori-ken\n## A sacred mountain and temple complex with a history of more than 1,300 years\nMt. Mitoku is the jewel in Tottori's mountainous crown. One of three sacred mountain asceticism sites in Japan, Mt. Mitoku is an important pilgrimage spot for travelers. Renowned for its breathtaking views, the short but challenging hiking course to the uppermost temple of the Sanbutsuji Temple complex is an adventurer's dream.\n### Don't Miss\n- Take off your shoes and enjoy views from the veranda of Monjudo Temple\n- Ring the two-ton bell to announce your presence to the mountain gods\n## How to Get There\nUse a combination of train and bus, or plane, train and bus travel options to reach Mt. Mitoku.\nThe closest transport point to Mt. Mitoku is Kurayoshi Station on the JR West Sanin Main Line. From the station, take a bus from Bus Stop No. 3. Your journey should take around 40 minutes.\nFrom Tokyo by plane, flights run from Haneda Airport to Tottori Airport. You can then get a bus to JR Kurayoshi Station. The bus trip takes about an hour.\nIf traveling by train from Tokyo, take a bullet train to JR Kyoto Station. Take the Super-Hakuto Express to Kurayoshi Station.\nFrom Osaka, take the Super-Hakuto Express from JR Shin-Osaka Station to Kurayoshi Station.\n### Quick Facts\nWhether you can climb or not depends on the weather—you cannot climb to the upper temples after snowfall\nParts of the mountain cannot be climbed alone; if traveling by yourself, ask fellow hikers for permission to join them\nMitoku means the three primary virtues of Buddhism: wisdom, renunciation and judgment\nA pilgrimage to Mt. Mitoku is said to purify your six roots of perception: eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body and mind\n### The climb to Nageiredo\nThe priests of Sanbutsuji Temple proudly refer to the Nageiredo Temple as “Japan's most dangerous National Treasure.” The temple itself is not dangerous, but the hiking path to it is somewhat precarious. Having said that, the ascent and descent to the uppermost temple is almost always completed without incident.\nThe inherent dangerous nature of the pilgrimage is an essential component of a visit to Mt. Mitoku. It is believed that by embarking on a hazardous journey your senses will be honed and improved. This training is called the “Way of the Ascetics.”\n### Where it pays to be prepared\nFrom the parking areas and bus stop, first ascend a steep set of stone stairs to the lower temples of the complex. A small fee is required to reach the beginning of the hiking trail.\nAfter further stairs find Sanbutsji Temple and an offer of free tea. Behind the temple is the beginning of the hiking trail where you must register and pay a fee to continue. If the tread of your shoes is deemed insufficient, purchase waraji sandals to complete your journey. Cotton gloves to protect your hands are optional.\nYou will be given a ceremonial sash to wear during your climb.\n### Outstanding views across a lush valley await\nEnter through a gate and over a small bridge, Yadoiribashi, the entry point to the sacred mountain. Roots and lianas decorate the steep climb to the top of the ridge. The path now levels out somewhat until you reach an angled rock-face on which the Monjudo Temple rests. A series of chains lead to the temple.\nTravelers take off their shoes and walk around the temple veranda for stunning views of the lush valley below. On a clear day, see the lower slopes of Mt. Daisen and even across the Sea of Japan to the Oki Islands in neighboring Shimane Prefecture.\n### A one-of-a-kind architectural treasure\nThe path continues along steep ridges and through bamboo groves until you turn the final corner. You'll then see Nageiredo Temple at the entrance of a cave.\n### Fortune telling and flowers\nIn the late seventh century, the Japanese mystic En no Gyoja was said to have thrown three petals of a lotus into the air saying that they \"should fly down to places related to gods and Buddha.\" One landed at Yoshino in Nara Prefecture, one at Ishizuchiyama in Ehime Prefecture, and one at Mt. Mitoku.\n## Keywords"}

The waters here are considered to be therapeutic and beneficial in treating all kinds of ailments.\nIn addition to onsen bathing, you can refresh your spirit by walking out in the woods. Known as forest bathing, such woodland walks have been scientifically proven to enhance your mood. Single travelers may want to head for Koitani Bridge, which has a frog that according to legend will help you find a spouse.\n### Don't Miss\n- The world's most radium-enriched hot springs\n- The kajika frog perched on Koitani Bridge, said to bless singles with a spouse if rubbed\n- Forest bathing to revive your spirit\n### Quick Facts\nThe hot spring's origins can be traced to the 12th century\nYou can cleanse your six senses with a three-night stay\nMisasa Onsen received Japan Heritage status in 2015\n## How to Get There\nLocal buses connect Misasa Onsen to Kurayoshi Station in around 25 minutes.\nThere are highway buses from Osaka and Hiroshima, bound for Kurayoshi, which also stop at Misasa Royal Hotel, around three kilometers from the main onsen area.\n### Where the line between history and legend blurs\nIn 1164, Okubo Samanosuke, a samurai warrior and vassal of the mighty Minamoto no Yoshitomo clan, came to Misasa (\"Three Mornings\") on a pilgrimage to nearby Mt. Mitoku.\nDuring the journey, he encountered a white wolf but decided to spare its life. That night, the Myoken Bodhisattva appeared in Samanosuke's dreams. In gratitude for sparing the wolf, the deity revealed where magical hot springs could be found, their waters gushing with miraculous, healing properties.\nMarked by a statue of Samanosuke and the wolf, this site is home to a small bathhouse, drinking fountain and a footbath, the perfect place for some quick rest and relaxation.\n### Bathe with the locals, like a local\nFor many, using the Kawara bath located next to the river is the ultimate in onsen experiences. Outdoors, mixed gender and in full view of visitors passing over the bridge, the fear of committing cultural faux pas can be a little overwhelming. As with most onsen, bathers are completely naked, so bring a small towel along.\nYou can preserve some modesty by disrobing behind the screen next to the bath or even by the side of the path. Using one of the available tubs, rinse before washing yourself until squeaky clean, then rinse off before entering the bath. Relax for as long as you like.\n### Forest bathing—a natural boost for your immunity\nThe Misasa hot springs have the highest levels of radium of any hot springs in the world. It is said if you bathe in its waters for three consecutive days, your health will improve. This is based on the theory of hormesis, where small doses of radiation are beneficial to health.\nVarious simple bathhouses and more upmarket ryokan bathing facilities throughout the town are available for use at a small cost. Reasonably priced, Misasakan is a popular choice with locals and visitors alike. Be aware that accommodations become scarce during the annual festival celebrating Marie Curie.\n### Rokkan chiyu—cleansing the six senses\n“Rokkan” refers to the six senses, while “chiyu” means “heal.” Here and at nearby Mt. Mitoku, a sixth sense is recognized, one's spirit or soul. Soothe all your senses, including your soul, by relaxing, bathing, drinking local waters and inhaling the radon-infused steam.\n### Stroll to the sounds of a frog chorus\nAn attractive stone path lined with inns, shops and an arcade filled with retro games runs through the onsen area. At its center are a footbath and a small temple. As you cross the river, listen for the kajika frogs and their unique chorus of croaks. Oddly enough, a person with a beautiful singing voice is referred to as a \"kajika\" in Japan.\n## Keywords"}

The Sendai River carries sediment from the nearby Chugoku Mountains that eventually washes out into the Sea of Japan. Strong sea currents and winds work together to push these sediments back onto the shore to form the sand dunes.\nThese same intense winds continuously move and re-shape the dunes. Over millennia, the sand deposits have created a 30-square kilometer golden landscape that stretches nearly 16 kilometers along the coast. Some of the dunes reach a towering 50 meters.\n### A giant, sandy playground\nFor many, a couple of hours spent around the largest of the dunes will be enough to feel amazed, snap some photos and enjoy the spectacular view.\nHowever, there are other fun activities too, like paragliding or sandboarding.\nConsider taking a leisurely ride on one of the dunes' iconic camels, or board the chairlift to the Sakyu Center's observation deck for the best view of the coast. Don't miss the Tottori Sand Dunes Visitor Center, where you can learn more about the geology and ecology of this special area.\n### Discover Tottori\nFor adventurous travelers with a more flexible schedule, the Tottori Sand Dunes make a great starting point for exploring the rest of the prefecture.\nAway from the crowds and souvenir shops, amazing discoveries await in a corner of Japan rarely seen by outsiders. Hike the holy mountains of Mt. Mitoku or Mt.

Winding through the mountains of Honshu's Kii Peninsula, an area straddling Wakayama, Nara, Osaka and Mie prefectures, it's been walked by pilgrims on their quest for enlightenment for over a millennium.\nModern travelers come to experience moments of quiet contemplation, commune with nature, and go deep into Japan's spiritual history.\n### Don't Miss\n- Treading the same paths as past pilgrims, including ascetics, samurai, emperors, and monks\n- Kumano Nachi-taisha Shrine and its temple, a perfect example of Shinto-Buddhist fusion\n- Taking advantage of the luggage shuttle services along the route so you can trek baggage free\n## How to Get There\nThe pilgrimage trails crisscross the Kii Peninsula, and access depends on your ultimate destination and how far you wish to hike. The main means of transportation to the area are Osaka, Kyoto, and Nagoya using the Kisei Mainline (also known as the Kinokuni line).\nTo access Kumano Nachi Taisha Shrine and Nachi Seigantoji Temple, take a 30-minute bus from Kii-Katsuura Station (on the JR Kinokuni Line) to the parking lot in front of the shrine and temple.\nAccess Kumano Hayatama Taisha via a 15-minute walk from JR Shingu Station, also on the JR Kinokuni Line.\nKumano Hongu Taisha is approximately an hour and 15 minutes from Kii-Tanabe Station (on the JR Kinokuni Line) via Ryujin Bus on the Kumano Hongu Line. Get off at Kumano Hongu Taisha-mae.\n### Quick Facts\nThe entire pilgrimage route is made up of seven trails\nIn 2004 the traditional trails along with their holy mountains were designated a UNESCO World Heritage site\nA mythical three-legged crow is the symbol of the Kumano Kodo, and of Japan's national soccer team\n### Kumano, the dwelling place of the gods\nSince its earliest days, the Kumano region has been regarded as a spiritually powerful area where gods inhabit the very fabric of the natural landscape.\nDuring the Heian Period (794-1185), former emperors began making the arduous trek to the region in search of spiritual enlightenment. The pilgrimage gradually became more widely known from that time.\n### The spiritual triumvirate of Kumano Sanzan\nKumano Sanzan is the collective name for the area's three most sacred shrines: Kumano Hayatama Taisha Shrine, Kumano Nachi Taisha Shrine (including adjoining Nachi Seigantoji Temple) and Kumano Hongu Taisha Shrine.\nTogether they are the sacred center of the Kumano region. Uniquely designed and originally offering separate forms of nature worship, the three eventually merged, becoming a major pilgrimage destination.\n### 99 Oji Shrines as spiritual signposts\nWhile the Kumano Sanzan shrines remain the big draw of the pilgrimage, many smaller shrines are scattered along the route. Known as the 99 Oji Shrines, their purpose is to provide protection and guidance for the wandering pilgrims.\n### Religious harmony through Shinbutsu-shugo\nBefore political policy forced them apart in the late 19th century, Buddhism and Shinto coexisted quite peacefully as Shinbutsu-shugo, a fusion of the two belief systems. Shinto gods were considered to be indigenous manifestations of Buddhist deities. This was the norm in Japan for over a thousand years.\nIn the 19th century, Buddhism was separated from Shinto and many temples and Buddhist statues were destroyed.\nWhile it's relatively rare to find Buddhist and Shinto elements intertwined today, Kumano Nachi Taisha Shrine and the adjoining Nachi Seigantoji Temple illustrate the traditional relationship very well.\n## Keywords"}
