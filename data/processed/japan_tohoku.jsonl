The devastating earthquake and tsunami that struck in 2011 brought out the resilient nature of Tohoku's people, and local passion and pride are putting the area back on its feet. There's a lot to be proud of—dramatic landscapes, history-rich sites, craft sake and a host of outdoor activities like rafting, hiking and skiing.

Bordered by the sea and mountains, this peaceful city is home to major local festivals, museums of world-class art and a well-preserved samurai village. It's easy to immerse yourself in Japan's cultural past here.\n### Don't Miss\n- The Akita Kanto Matsuri, a scenic summer festival held in early August\n- The castle ruins and seasonal blooms at Senshu Park\n- The Akita Museum of Art, built by renowned Japanese architect Ando Tadao and featuring works by Leonard Foujita\n## How to Get There\nAkita is served by a shinkansen stop and an airport, so it's easily accessible from all over Japan.\nFrom Tokyo, it's a four-hour trip to Akita Station on the JR Akita Shinkansen. Both JAL and ANA operate multiple flights between Tokyo's Haneda Airport and Akita Airport that take a little over an hour. From Osaka or Kyoto, the best option is first to ride the Tokaido-Sanyo Shinkansen to Tokyo and then switch to the Akita-bound shinkansen. You can also take a 75-minute flight from Osaka's Itami Airport to Akita Airport.\n### Breathtaking seasonal festivals\nAkita is home to many breathtaking seasonal festivals. The Akita Kanto Matsuri, held from 3 until 6 August, is considered one of the Tohoku region's three greatest festivals. One of the highlights is watching participants compete to see who can perform the most difficult balancing act as they balance impossibly tall bamboo poles adorned with a massive number of lanterns on their foreheads or hips.\nThe big winter attraction is the Yokote Kamakura Festival. Local children fill the area with hundreds of igloo-shaped snow domes, called kamakura. Illuminated by night, these domes become temporary dedications to the Japanese water deity. There are all kinds of snow sculptures of fanciful creatures and more, and other kamakura big enough for humans to sit inside and sip warming beverages.\nOga, a city just an hour from Akita, is famous for its visiting deities, namahage, who roam the streets at New Year, scaring small children into promising good behavior during the coming year.\n### Modern architecture and world-class art\nOpened in 2013, The Akita Museum of Art is an impressive gallery filled with a broad selection of contemporary local art and historically valuable artifacts. Designed by architect Tadao Ando, the museum's free-standing staircase and triangular skylight have become architectural and artistic icons in their own right. The collection boasts works by Goya, Picasso, Rubens, and Rembrandt.\n### Japan meets the west in art\nThe star attraction at the museum is the extensive collection of work by Tokyo-born, France-based painter Fujita Tsuguharu (also known as Leonard Foujita). One of the few collections of his work in Japan, Tsuguharu's blend of traditional Japanese and French styles has captivated audiences for almost a century. A particular Foujita masterpiece portrays Akita's festivals and changing seasons on what's been called the world's largest canvas painting.\n### A colorful oasis in the city\nSenshu Park was once the site of Kubota Castle, built in 1604, which was burned down during the Meiji period (1868-1912). Now, only the moat, castle gate, and watchtower remain. The moat area has been repurposed and crafted into a series of ponds. Transforming with the seasons, the park becomes a sea of soft pink every spring with the cherry blossoms. Weeping wisteria also lend the park a regal air. Senshu Park is alive in the lush summer when the lotuses bloom, and turns fiery red in autumn with the changing of momiji maple leaves.\n### A bird's-eye view\nThe 100-meter high observation tower, Akita City Port Tower Selion, provides a panoramic view of the city from the Sea of Japan in the west to Oga Peninsula in the north and Mt Chokai in the south. Sunset offers the most spectacular views.\nThe complex and its surrounding area has parks and play areas allowing guests to take in the city's natural beauty. The area often hosts a flea market and is home to a range of shops and restaurants.\n### Going beyond the city\nThe greater Akita area is surrounded by many various towns and natural getaways that offer everything from history to relaxation to adventure. For history and adventure visit the well-preserved former castle town and samurai village of Kakunodate.\nAnother spot worth exploring is Nyuto Onsenkyo, a picturesque hot spring resort located in the eastern mountains of Akita Prefecture. Not far away is Japan's deepest lake, Tazawa Lake, which changes color over the year from shades of deep jade to sapphire blue."}

The impressive samurai and merchant quarters will give you an idea of life in Japan's feudal past.\nJust outside the city is Dakigaeri Gorge, a mountain valley that is great for a nature walk along the Tamagawa River through cedar forests and over suspension bridges and trestles.\nKakunodate is known for its weeping cherry trees, which bloom in spring.\n### Don't Miss\n- The weeping cherry trees that bloom in May\n- The magnificent samurai houses, barely touched by time\n- Elegant cherry-bark crafts in the merchant district\n- Commanding views from the former castle site\n## How to Get There\nFrom Tokyo, it's a three-hour trip on the JR Akita Shinkansen, which stops at Kakunodate Station, or a one-hour flight from Tokyo Haneda Airport to Akita Airport.\n### The cherry blossom journey from Kyoto to Akita\nMore than a million people journey to see Kakunodate's thousands of cherry trees bloom, making it one of the country's most famous hanami or cherry blossom viewing spots. The blossoms that line the streets and river banks are at their best during late April or early May.\nThe weeping cherry trees in the samurai district were planted in the 17th century, brought back from Kyoto by local samurai families. Stroll under the blooms in the streets of the samurai quarter for an authentic cherry blossom viewing experience.\nSomei yoshino cherry trees along the Hinokinai River turn the river pink in full bloom. Bring some food and drink to the riverbank and join the locals to party under the gently falling petals.\n### History comes alive\nFlourishing as a castle town in the early 17th century, the samurai district homes in Kakunodate have been preserved in a marvelously unspoiled state. Strolling the wide streets, it's easy to imagine the area filled with historical figures.\nExplore the area where 80 samurai families once lived, and see the best examples of Japanese residential architecture from the 17th and 18th centuries. These houses show how middle-class and wealthy samurai families lived. Six of the houses including the Aoyagi House, are open to the public.\nThe Aoyagi samurai manor provides an opportunity to understand Japan's feudal period through dynamic displays. There are museums, galleries, a restaurant, and gift shop within the grounds.\nJust down the street is the Ishiguro manor. Still a private home, it's not fully open to visitors, but part of the main house and the storehouse can be viewed.\n### A fall festival with massive floats\nKakunodate is beautiful in fall, and marks the season with a festival in early September called Kakunodate Festival that dates back more than 350 years. Massive seven-ton floats are pulled through the town accompanied by traditional dancers and music.\n### Shopping in 400-year-old stores\nDating from 1620, Kakunodate's merchant district was separate from the samurai district, reflecting the division between the classes at the time.\nStroll along the wide streets lined with historic buildings that remain largely unchanged. The impressive brick structure of the Ando Jozo Miso storehouse stocks miso and soy sauce, which have been produced using the same method for over 150 years. Buy some to take home a taste of history.\n### From delicate blossoms to elegant crafts\nMany local crafts use Kakunodate's cherry-tree bark, beginning when a 18th-century samurai named Fujimura Hikoroku began working with it. This stunning craftsmanship is used to make trinkets, jewelry boxes and furniture.\nThe red brick Denshokan Museum exhibits various regional crafts and offers demonstrations of kabazaiku (cherry-bark art) in which boxes, tea implements and pieces of furniture are covered with cherry bark.\n### Commanding views from the castle ruins\nHike up the town's steep hillside to where the local fortress, Kakunodate Castle, once stood. Though no traces of the original castle remain, the commanding view of the surrounding area explains why the site was chosen in the 1500s. The castle made Kakunodate the heart of the region's power.\nWhen the city's cherry blossom trees are in full bloom, the view from the top of the hill is of pink and white fluffy clouds, making it a popular spot during the spring.\nBefore you go, be sure to grab some of the town's traditional sweets, called morokoshi. Made from refined adzuki beans, they make a delicious souvenir."}

Major transport hubs include Noshiro Station, Akita Station and Yunosawa Onsen Bus Station.\nBy plane, it is just over one hour from Tokyo Haneda Airport to Odate-Noshiro Airport, followed by a 45-minute taxi ride to Noshiro Station. From there, take the JR Gono Line to Akita Shirakami Station (35 minutes). By train, take the JR Tohoku Shinkansen from Tokyo Station to Akita Station (4 hours), then take the JR Ou Line to Futatsui Station (60 minutes), then take the Akikita Bus to Yunosawa Onsen (30 minutes). To get to the Aomori side, it takes about three hours from Tokyo Station to Shin-Aomori Station on the JR Tohoku Shinkansen, followed by a 40-minute train from Shin-Aomori Station to Hirosaki Station on the JR Ou Line, and then a 50-minute bus ride from Hirosaki Bus Terminal to Tashiro. You can also get to the Aomori side by bus from Hirosaki Station to the Shirakami Sanchi Visitor Centre.\n### Untouched primeval forest\nCovering over 130,000 hectares in the prefectures of Aomori and Akita, the Shirakami Mountains boast such a diversity of flora and rare fauna that the mountain range's central region has been a World Natural Heritage site since 1993.\n### A haven for unusual flora and fauna\nIn addition to the native beech trees, the ancient forest has many other species of tall deciduous trees. Take a walk along forest paths for a chance to see wildlife, including black woodpeckers, Japanese serow, mountain hawk-eagles and golden eagles, Japanese macaques and Asiatic black bears.\n### Three waterfalls in one\nOne of the most beautiful places within the Shirakami Mountains is Anmon Falls, three stunning waterfalls that run together as one. Hike along the nature trails through the lush woods and along the river and streams of crystal-clear water from melted snow.\n### Discover the secrets of this singular place\nLearn more about the Shirakami Mountains and the local culture at the Shirakami Mountains Visitor Center or Shirakami World Heritage Center. There are 3D exhibitions giving visitors a good insight into the area.\n### Cruise or camp by the sparkling waters of Lake Towada\nThis popular tourist spot on the border between Aomori and Akita prefectures is the largest crater lake in Honshu and the 12th-largest lake in Japan.\nYou can cruise the lake by boat, hire a canoe or pitch your tent at one of the campsites to get closer to the stunning natural environment. There are six campgrounds in the area, three very close to the lake and the others closer to Mt. Hakkoda.\nLake Towada is home to many varieties of freshwater trout and salmon, and there are several restaurants around the lake that serve up fish dishes.\n### Maintaining ancient hunting traditions\nThe area is known for its matagi, the community of traditional hunters who live in the Shirakami Sanchi forest between Akita and Aomori prefectures. These tribal people live in hamlets in the mountainous area, but during winter and early spring they live deep in the forest, hunting bear the same way their ancestors have done for generations.\n### Elegant, graceful woodwork\nThe Odate area is famous for magewappa, a Japanese woodcraft known for its lightness, elegance and straight grain. Artisans have been delicately steaming and bending wood into graceful, flowing shapes for more than 400 years, when locals began to use their main natural resource, cedar, to make everyday objects."}

With plenty of opportunities to get active outdoors, there's no shortage of things to see and do here.\n### Don't Miss\n- The Kamakura Festival with its illuminated mini-igloos\n- The National Firework Competition held every summer\n- Cherry blossom viewing at Mato Park in late April\n## How to Get There\nYokote Station is accessible by train and is serviced by the JR Ou Main Line and Kitakami Line.\nFrom Tokyo Station, take the Akita Shinkansen to Omagari Station and switch to the Ou Line. From there, Yokote Station is one stop. From Osaka and Kyoto, the quickest way to get to the area is via airplane. However, if you want to travel by train, make your way to Tokyo and catch the Akita Shinkansen from there.\n### A city of snow\nYokote is home to the famous Yokote Snow Festival, a 450-year-old celebration held every year in February when igloo-like snow huts called kamakura, are built all over the city.\nInside each kamakura is a small snow altar dedicated to the water deity as well as a brazier used to store hot coals and keep the snow hut warm. During the festival season children offer rice cakes and amazake (sweet rice wine) to festival visitors, and in return visitors make an offering to the water deity.\n### Fireworks light up the summer sky\nWhen the weather gets warmer, the festivities heat up too. Held each summer, the Omagari Fireworks Festival sees almost 800,000 spectators swarm to the area to witness one of Japan's most impressive fireworks festivals. One of the largest of its kind, the festival features beautiful fireworks shows along with music and stories.\nThis event is not only a spectacle of colorful light but also a contest. Fireworks teams from all over Japan descend on the festival to try to outdo each other.\n### Blooming pink\nVisit Yokote's Mato Park Cherry Blossom Festival in April to see breathtaking somei yoshino and wild cherry trees in bloom. The 2,000 cherry trees transform Mato Park into a sea of pale pink under which local people picnic, relax and celebrate the coming of spring.\n### Tiny but beautiful Yokote Castle\nOne of the area's most popular tourist attractions, the castle that stands today in Yokote Park is actually a reconstruction of a castle built by the Onodera clan. Inside is a well-maintained museum where you can learn all about the city's history."}

There are four shinkansen stops in the prefecture—Hachinohe, Shichinohe-Towada, Shin-Aomori and Okutsugaru-Imabetsu. You can also fly to two airports—Misawa and Aomori.\nTokyo is the most common starting point for visitors to Aomori, unless you are traveling by plane. The JR Tohoku Shinkansen will get you to the main city of Aomori in just over three hours, and you can use your Japan Rail Pass. By plane, it takes a little over an hour from Haneda Airport to either of the two Aomori airports and around 90 minutes if you are departing from Osaka. Highway buses run regularly between Tokyo and Aomori, but they will take around 8-10 hours, and are usually overnight.\nAomori Airport serves international flights from several countries in East Asia, while its domestic routes connect Aomori to Sapporo, Osaka, Kobe and Nagoya, in addition to Tokyo.\n### Don’t Miss\n- Aomori's colorful festivals—Aomori Nebuta, Hirosaki Neputa, and Goshogawara Tachineputa, the Snow Lantern and Cherry Blossom Festival at Hirosaki Castle\n- World Heritage Site Shirakami Sanchi and Sanriku Fukko National Park\n- Ancient ruins and great temples, shrines, castles, and Aoni Onsen, a remote hot spring resort with a traditional ryokan lit only by gas lantern\n- Unrivaled seafood from the cold waters of both the Sea of Japan and Pacific Ocean\n## Explore Aomori by Area\n- \\\\\nAomori City & Around\n- \\\\\nHirosaki & Around\n- \\\\\nLake Towada & Around\n## Trending Attractions in Aomori\n- Hirosaki Park Cherry Blossom-SPRHirosaki Park Cherry Blossom-SPR\\\\\nHirosaki Castle\n- Aoni Onsen\\\\\nAoni Onsen\n- Aomori Museum of Art\\\\\nAomori Museum of Art\n- Oirase Mountain Stream\\\\\nOirase Gorge\n- Nebuta house Warasse Nebuta Museum\\\\\nNebuta Museum\n## Local Specialties\n- Aomori Black Garlic\nBlack garlic is made by maturing and fermenting white garlic for several weeks in an environment of constant temperature and humidity. It is believed that the darkening of the garlic is due to a chemical reaction called the Maillard reaction. The black garlic becomes sweeter, with a texture like dried fruit.\n- Tsugaru Lacquerware\nTsugaru lacquerware is characterised by its robustness and practicality, but also by its extremely elegant appearance. The technique used in Tsugaru-nuri is a method of smoothing and polishing multiple layers of lacquer to create a pattern. It takes dozens of processes and more than two months to achieve a complex and beautiful lacquer pattern and a sturdy and solid feel. Once used for sword scabbards, this technique is now used for everything from tableware and chopsticks to smartphone cases.\n- Tsugaru Painted Kites\nTraditional Tsugaru kites, depicting brave warriors, have been made since the Edo period (1603-1868) as extra work for local samurai. While kite frames are usually made from bamboo, the cold weather in the Tsugaru region made it difficult for bamboo to grow, and thinly shaved hiba wood, which is light and elastic, was used instead.\nKite paintings are often based on heroes and heroic figures from classical novels as well as heroic warriors from Japanese history. The warriors are drawn with thick, strong ink lines and bright red colours, and are as attractive to the eye as the Hirosaki Neputa floats.\n- Aomori Apples\nAomori Prefecture produces around 60% of Japan's apples. From pruning the branches in winter to the harvest in autumn, the procrss of apple cultivation takes place almost without a break. The delicious taste of Aomori apples is the result of the passionate and diligent work of the growers. Local souvenir shops sell a variety of desserts made from apples, including pies containing whole apples.\n- Ichigo-ni\nThis local dish was named after the image of sea urchin sinking into the milky white soup, which looked like \"wild strawberries in the morning mist\", and is said to have its roots in beach cooking by fishermen. This is a rich soup with plenty of sea urchin and abalone.\n## Seasonal Highlights\n- Spring\nAomori is covered with blooms in springtime—cherry blossoms at Hirosaki Castle, as well as apple blossoms, canola and azaleas—on a scale that is unparalleled in volume and beauty. There is still enough snow remaining in the higher altitudes for some relaxed spring skiing.\n- Summer\nThe deep green of virgin beech forests and the passionate festivities of summer festivals provide both serenity and raucous joy to rejuvenate the human spirit. Summer here is also time for getting outside and trekking, cycling and playing golf. The photogenic rice paddy art in Inakadate Village is also worth a visit.\n- Autumn\nThe rich, verdant and remote forests of Aomori turn from green to a colorful array of yellows, oranges, reds and browns. As the weather cools, this is also the season to slip into a hot spring.\n- Winter\nFor all of its rich green splendor, Aomori is snow country. Trees are transformed into snow monsters, and world-class skiing and snowboarding await you, along with winter festivals, foods and unusual cultural activities."}

Because it faces two oceans—the Sea of Japan and the Pacific—and with mountains, valleys, lakes, and shores—Aomori has year-round recreational possibilities.\nLike many rural prefectures, Aomori goes big when it comes to festivals. The Aomori Nebuta Festival, with its massive glowing floats and chants, singing and dancing, is one of Japan's standout events.\nThe art scene here is sophisticated, from the fine modern collection at the Aomori Museum of Art to unusual places like the Aomori Museum of History, featuring a collection of 67 traditional wooden fishing vessels.\n### Don't Miss\n- Illuminated floats from the Nebuta Festival displayed at the Nebuta Museum Wa Rasse Nebuta Museum\n- The Aomori Gyosai Center (also known as Furukawa Fish Market), the bustling seafood hub of Aomori\n- One of Japan's most respected contemporary museums, the Aomori Museum of Art\n## How to Get There\nAomori is easily accessible by train, bus, and airplane.\nJapan Airlines offers a number of daily flights between Tokyo's Haneda Airport and Aomori Airport. If you'd rather go by train, the JR Tohoku Shinkansen travels from Tokyo to Shin-Aomori regularly. The Konan Bus Company runs a number of day and overnight buses between Tokyo's Ueno Station and Aomori.\nIf you're in Kansai, you can fly to Aomori Airport from Osaka's Itami Airport.\n### One of the nation's biggest celebrations\nThe biggest event on Aomori Prefecture's calendar and its biggest tourist attraction is the Aomori Nebuta Festival, which runs every year from August 2 to 7. Locals parade through the streets pushing enormous lantern floats made from traditional washi paper while entertaining the crowd with Japanese dances and songs.\nYou can join the dance if you like, but you'll need to buy and wear the traditional haneto dancing costume beforehand.\n### Where festivals never die\nIf you miss the festival, you'll get nearly as much of a thrill out of the Nebuta House Wa Rasse Nebuta Museum, the city's year-round exhibit and tribute to this extraordinary event. You can learn all about the history of this fun and fascinating festival. If you're lucky, you may even catch a weekend performance by local haneto dancers.\n### Venturing into Aomori's raw natural beauty\nSoutheast Aomori has the Sanriku Fukko National Park, an area that extends from Hachinohe to Kessennuma in Miyagi Prefecture, 220 kilometers away. You'll be amazed by the sawtoothed rocks, bays, rock islands and cliffs.\nThe rugged Shirakami Mountains embrace the world's largest virgin forest of beech trees, a World Heritage Site. You can trek around the forest to explore places such as the Juniko Lakes—including the cobalt blue pond called Aoike—the Shirakami Promenade, filled with unusual flora and fauna, as well as Nihon Canyon and Anmon Falls.\nFor those feeling more adventurous, check out Shimokita Hanto, a peninsula shaped like the head of an ax that is home to one of the most sacred sites in Japanese Buddhism, Mt Osore. The peak, which smells of sulfur and is surrounded by a desolate landscape, is considered one of Japan's three most sacred places. Must-see sights nearby include Sai no Kawara (a pebble-filled riverbed) and the vivid waters of the caldera lake, seen from the shore of Gokurakuhama.\n### Seafood doesn't get any better than this\nSituated on Mutsu Bay, Aomori has many great places to dive headfirst into the bounty of the sea. The Aomori Gyosai Center ( Furukawa Fish Market ) is the city's most famous. Be sure to try the nokkedon, a rice bowl topped with the seafood of your choice.\n### Tsugaru's sights and sounds\nTsugaru Hanto is a peninsula that juts out toward Hokkaido. It's the birthplace of the Tsugaru shamisen, a three-stringed guitar-like instrument popularly used in local folk music. Tappizaki Cape is the northernmost point on the peninsula, a place where wild winds blow year round.\nFor trekkers and climbers, Mt Iwaki is the place to be. There are several routes up what is known as the Fuji of Tsugaru. If you're going to Anmon Falls, you can stay at the Aqua Green Village campground and follow the Anmon River all the way there. Tours are available for these treks.\nA ride on the Tsugaru Railway, which runs across the southern part of the peninsula, is highly recommended. This slow-running train stops frequently, and depending on the season may have wind bells mounted, baskets filled with bell crickets, or will be equipped with stoves in the winter.\n### Step back in time\nHistory buffs shouldn't miss the Korekawa Jomon Museum in Hachinohe, or the Sannai Maruyama Site, near the Aomori Museum of Art. These archeological sites date back to the Jomon period (which spanned from about 15,000 to 2,400 years ago), the point when many academics believe Japan began to build a level of cultural complexity.\nBoth display artifacts and structures of the period. The Sannai Maruyama Site has several restored buildings to investigate, including one with pillars sunk into the ground, a large dwelling built into a dugout, and a warehouse with a raised floor.\n### A cultural capital of Japan\nFrom prehistoric to contemporary culture, Aomori is home to one of Japan's most respected modern art museums, the Aomori Museum of Art. It is built predominantly underground, set deep into the earth to replicate the nearby archeological trenches. Featuring work by local and international talent, it's filled with artistic and architectural delights, including pieces from Marc Chagall and Paul Klee."}

From there, the local train to Hirosaki takes 30-40 minutes. All trains are covered by the Japan Rail Pass.\nFlights from Tokyo to Aomori take about an hour and 20 minutes. From the airport, a bus to Hirosaki takes about an hour.\nA variety of highway buses depart from Tokyo and travel during the day or overnight. These take around 10 hours.\n### A grand castle\nHirosaki is the area's main city and transport hub. It is also a well-preserved castle town with Hirosaki Castle at the center. Built by the Tsugaru clan, it is especially well known today for its spectacular cherry blossoms in the spring, its botanical garden, and the stately Gokoku Shrine. During the Cherry Blossom Festival, rowing boats can be hired at the outer moat of Hirosaki Park.\n### Seasonal festivals\nWhether you visit for winter's Snow Lantern Festival, the Cherry Blossom Festival in the spring, summer's Neputa Festival, or the autumn foliage, Hirosaki Castle and its grounds are beautiful. Due to be finished around 2025, renovations to the stone foundation offer insights into how Japanese castles were built.\n### Hiking in Shirakami Sanchi\nWith such fascinating places close by, Hirosaki makes a natural hub for exploring further. The Shirakami Sanchi UNESCO World Heritage Site is the biggest draw, especially for hikers. There are 14 official hiking trails in Shirakami Sanchi, ranging from easy to hard-core mountain trekking and all offering spectacular vistas.\n### A string of stunning lakes\nLike a necklace of precious gems, there are 33 jewel-colored ponds and lakes scattered throughout the Shirakami Sanchi area. Thought to have formed when a massive earthquake caused a landslide, they are known as Juniko, or Twelve Lakes, because only 12 were visible from the collapsed mountain when they first formed. The most famous is a small pond called Aoike, which is a brilliant cobalt blue.\n### Three waterfalls in one\nAlso located in the Shirakami Sanchi, Anmon Falls are three waterfalls that appear as one connected vertically. A hike takes you along the river to the source of the water. Follow the trail up the cliff to see the base of each rushing fall. Throughout the area, the thick virgin beech forest embraces you with greenery.\n### Onsen bathing by oil lamp\nAoni Onsen is a traditional Japanese hot spring at which you bathe naked in the traditional style. The indoor baths are gender segregated, but be aware that the outdoor bath is mixed. There are two one-hour time slots when women can bathe outdoors privately.\nAoni Onsen is so remote that there is no cell phone reception, and the baths are lit only by oil lamps. Relax and unwind in this magical place where time stands still.\n### Hirosaki's eye-catching Neputa Festival\nThe Hirosaki Neputa Festival, held annually the first week of August, should not be missed. The main event is a parade made up of giant illuminated floats painted with brilliant depictions of warriors, samurai, and glamorous women. It celebrates the past returns of victorious warriors. As night falls, the majestic floats glow in the dark."}

With the Towada Art Center as its anchor, the city's charms include an unspoiled natural environment and a community around the lake that now draws tourists up to this northern prefecture from all over the world.\n### Don't Miss\n- The Towada Art Center's bold contemporary treasures\n- The atmospheric beauty of Oirase Mountain Stream\n- Riding the Mt Hakkoda ropeway\n## How to Get There\nYou can reach the Towada area via car or a combination of train and bus.\nTowada is not directly accessible by train.

The bus takes a little more than 10 hours, including rest stops.\n### How a commitment to art changed everything\nTowada Art Center is the creative nexus of this region and a grand symbol of its revitalization. When the city of Towada made the bold decision to transform the town center, it put the art center at its heart.\nIn less than a decade, Towada became a popular venue for contemporary art lovers and other tourists by featuring works by world-renowned artists such as Ron Mueck and Yayoi Kusama. There are hundreds of reviews about Towada Art Center on travel sites.\n### Liquid poetry in motion\nClear, beautiful, magical Oirase Mountain Stream is a meandering, cascading route that stretches for 14 kilometers. You can hike along all or part of it since a bus route runs roughly parallel to the flow. You can also rent bicycles and ride alongside the stream.\nThe many waterfalls in Towada are definitely a highlight, but the trees, moss, deep greenery, dark soil, sounds of cascading water, and solitude of the bridges crisscrossing the stream are what make the stream a magical, meditative experience.\n### Land of the snow monsters\nMt Hakkoda is the collective name of several volcanoes, the main being Mt. Hakkoda. Hakkoda is a renowned are for backcountry powder skiing and snowboarding.\nFrom the gondola, you can see the rare “snow monsters” that populate the area—trees with shaggy coats of snow that look like fantastic creatures.\nThe best way to see the snow monsters is up close while skiing or snowboarding. You can even ski through “tree tunnels” surrounded by these monsters.\n### Marshlands, ponds, and other wilderness wonders\nThere are many other beautiful spots around Lake Towada and in the Mt Hakkoda area. One is Tashiro Marshland, a bog created by a volcano eruption nearly two million years ago. You can traverse this marshland over 1.5 kilometers of wooden plank walkways.\nSuiren-numa Pond is surrounded by a marsh, with the Hakkoda mountains as a backdrop. Suiren, a type of water lily, grows wild in the water, and the delicate white flowers create a scene reminiscent of a landscape painting by Claude Monet.\nThere are several great onsen in the area, including Yachi Onsen, a secluded inn that has been around for over four centuries."}

While you're there, dip into one of the world's largest open-air hot spring.\nJoban-Yumoto (also called Iwaki-Yumoto) has long been known for its hot springs. One of Japan's oldest hot springs is Iwaki Yumoto Onsen, still open for business after 1,300 years.\n### From the mountains to the sea\nIwaki is located close to Japan's rich fishing grounds known as the Shiome-no-Umi. You can get close to the local sea life at Aquamarine Fukushima aquarium and explore the facility's open-air wading pool.\nIf you like mountains and rivers, head to the cool, green forests of Natsuigawa valley. Many people visit in autumn to enjoy the beautiful fall colors.\n### Tradition, history, and renewal\nThe city's history can be explored at the Iwaki Coal and Fossil Museum, with exhibitions of life-size dioramas and dinosaur bones. Visit the 12th-century Shiramizu Amidado temple, which has one of the oldest surviving buildings in Fukushima. The gardens are beautiful in all seasons, but especially in fall, when the red autumn leaves are illuminated in the evenings. There is an even older monument about 30 kilometers south called the Nakoso Barrier. It is thought to have been built between the 5th and 8th century as a barrier to prevent invasion from the people of the north. It is also the site of a well-known waka poem.\nGet a glimpse of rural life long ago at the Iwaki City Museum of Folklore and Traditional Housing (Kurashi no Denshogo), which has a collection of traditional houses. Although exhibits are in Japanese, the buildings and traditional objects speak for themselves. From time to time, traditional folk dances are performed."}

Bandai are an easily accessible playground for those seeking winter thrills and powder snow. Yet boasting unparalleled hiking options, a world-class collection of Salvador Dali's artworks and a museum devoted to Hideyo Noguchi, to one of Japan's top scientists, the area is well worth a visit at any time of year.\n### Don't Miss\n- Perfect powder skiing at Mt. Bandai or Urabandai\n- A superb collection of Salvador Dali works at the Morohashi Museum of Modern Art\n- The rainbow colored hues of the Goshikinuma marshes and ponds\n- Soaking apres-ski in one of the area's many onsen\n## How to Get There\nThe best way to see Mt. Bandai, Lake Inawashiro and surrounding areas is by rental car but other options are available. If staying at a hotel, it might be worth checking to see if you can use a shuttle service from Koriyama Station, the closest shinkansen stop. Otherwise, transfer at Koriyama Station to Inawashiro Station via the 40-minute rapid train towards Aizu-Wakamatsu. From there you can walk, or take a bus or taxi to nearby facilities.\n### Visiting in spring\nVisit during spring, and you may be surprised to still find snow on Mt. Bandai. Urabandai, the back of the mountain, will even have ski resorts still open.\nAs the weather heats up, eventually the area's greenery and cherry blossoms spring to life. The “Oshika Zakura” elk cherry tree at Iwahashi Shrine, considered one of the Aizu district's five most famous cherry trees. It is well worth the 3.5-kilometer trip from Inawashiro Station for blossom lovers.\n### Visiting in summer\nThe summer months are slightly cooler here than the rest of Fukushima Prefecture. A refreshing swim in the crystal clear lake makes for a popular and seasonal activity. Rent sports equipment to go fishing, boardsailing, or water skiing around the northern Nagahama shore. Chilled soba noodles, made using the area's pristine natural underground water, are another area highlight.\n### Visiting in autumn\nUrabandai is well-known as an excellent place to view autumn leaves. Trek through the fiery yellows, oranges, and reds of the mountains at Goshikinuma, or sit back and enjoy the colors of these colorful ponds and lakes.\nThe whole area is a collection of 30 different-hued marshes and lakes, providing the perfect aesthetic contrast for which to compare the colors of the leaves.\nWhen you're done exploring, escape the cooler weather or rest after a long day hiking many of the area's trails in one of the several local hot springs.\n### Visiting in winter\nChill out during the long winter season in the ski resorts around Mt. Bandai. Gear up with skis or a snowboard for the Alts Bandai or Inawashiro ski resorts on the front side of the mountain and admire the lake from this improved vantage point.\nAlternatively, tackle Urabandai, the back of the mountain, open from early December to early May. Grandeco Snow Resort is known for its high-quality snow while Urabandai Nekoma resort is preferable if you want a more manageably-sized resort.\n### An unlikely spot to encounter Salvador Dali works\nThe Morohashi Museum of Modern Art, showcasing works by Salvador Dali, is the only museum in Asia offering a permanent exhibition of his art. With 330 such works on display, the museum boasts the third-largest collection of his works in the world, and is highly recommended for art fans unlikely to see other such collections abroad in Europe.\n### Stop by the Noguchi Hideyo Memorial Hall\nAn interesting side attraction is a museum dedicated to the man on the 1,000-yen note. Learn about the life and achievements of Dr. Hideyo Noguchi (1876-1928) famous for his research on yellow fever. Step inside his parents' home to view some of the personal items from his life and gain a unique insight into the life of the famous scientist."}

Within the temple complex, you will find Konjikido, completely lacquered and gilded inside, including the walls, ceilings and floors. The inside has a large number of gilded Buddhas covered in gilded lacquer and intricately inlaid with mother-of-pearl. The mummies of the first three lords of the area rest within the daises beneath the Buddhas, reposing in their own gilded paradise.\n### A little history\nThe first lord of Hiraizumi ruled the northern part of Japan essentially as a semi-autonomous region. This dominance lasted from about 1100 until 1189. The region was famous for its gold production and for horses, both highly important in the economy of the day, and the basis of the wealth and power of the domain. The semi-independence of the area was brought to an end in the process of creating the Kamakura shogunate (1192-1333).\n### Seasonal festivals and flowers\nDuring the spring and fall festivals you can see plays being performed outdoors on the Noh Stage at the temple. There are also two fall festivals at Chusonji: the Fujiwara Autumn Festival and the Chrysanthemum Festival.

On the way back to the dock, the driver of the boat will serenade you with a traditional song.\n### Feed them or eat them\nWhile enjoying the views at Geibikei Gorge, you can buy fish food and feed the fish crowding the river. A different type of fish is cooked and sold as a snack at the entrance to the gorge.\n### Two spectacular gorges, two easy-to-confuse names\nThere are actually two gorges in the Hiraizumi area, Geibikei Gorge and Genbikei Gorge. If you are going to one of the gorges, double-check that you are going to the right place, since even Japanese people get the names confused.\n### The polished stones of Genbikei\nOver eons, the Iwai River has eroded the volcanic rock in its path to form Genbikei Gorge. The rapidly running water has polished the rocks to fashion a smooth yet rugged landscape.\n### Eat flying dumplings\nGenbikei is most famous for its flying dango or rice dumplings. You order the dango on one side of the river by putting money into a basket attached to a rope and sending it to the shop across the river. The order is put in the basket and sent back to you.

After the devastation of the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami in 2011, the resilient locals are rebuilding. Dine on the freshest seafood, enjoy unmatched views and be part of the coastal revitalization.\nThe coastline is a gateway to several world-famous islands including the Cat Island and the Pine Islands.\n### Don't Miss\n- Spectacular sea views that have inspired artists and poets for centuries\n- Fresh seafood including all you can eat oysters in winter\n- The famous 260 pine-covered islands, considered one of the most beautiful sights in Japan\n## How to Get There\nThe capital of Miyagi, Sendai, is your gateway to all locations across the coast.\nThe Hayabusa or Yamabiko Shinkansen from Tokyo will get you to Sendai in around an hour and a half. The JR Senseki Line from Sendai takes about 40 minutes to reach Matsushima.\n©Miyagi Prefecture\n### The pine islands\nThe 260 pine-covered islands of Matsushima Bay have inspired poets and travelers for centuries. In autumn, the harvest moon over the bay offers breathtaking views of the islands, silhouetted against the silvery water.\n©Miyagi Prefecture\nFind the best view of the islands by taking a 45-minute ferry ride around the bay. Sit in the warm inside carriages or pay a little extra to sit on the unobstructed top deck to feel and taste the salty sea breeze.\n### A bridge to another world\nThree of the islands can be accessed by footbridges from the mainland. Visit mysterious Oshima with caves carved out by ancient meditating monks; pray at Godaido, a tiny island next to the ferry port considered to be the symbol of Matsushima; then stretch your legs with a walk across the 252-meter-long red bridge to Fukuura Island for a view of both the bay and the Matsushima coastline.\nDon't miss Zuiganji, the most important Zen temple in the Tohoku region. The grand but simple buildings enclosed by cedar trees evoke a sense of spiritual calm. Zuiganji and the smaller nearby temples were built by feudal warlord Date Masamune and his family, who ruled most of the Tohoku region in the 16th and 17th centuries.\n©Miyagi Prefecture\n### The life of the sea\nMiyagi Prefecture is part of the Sanriku Coastal Area, considered one of the most abundant fishing grounds in the world. At the fish markets in Kesennuma, you can see huge tuna, swordfish, and saury. Each of the major fishing ports along the coast has its own charm and character.\n### Shiogama: heaven for sushi lovers\nThe port of Shiogama is said to have the most sushi restaurants in Japan, a testament to the quality of the local catch. Shiogama is just a 15-minute train ride from Sendai, and the fish market is a great place to try a \"My Donburi\": get a bowl of rice, then meander through the market adding fresh fish toppings.\nShiogama Shrine is said to be around 1,000 years old and is one of the most important Shinto shrines in Tohoku. Climbing the 202 stairs to the entrance rewards climbers with spectacular views from the vermillion red buildings.\n### Ishinomaki: tragedy and triumph\nThe seaside town of Ishinomaki experienced the worst loss of life caused by the 2011 tsunami. However, visitors will see the pride and fighting spirit of the citizens, symbolized by the “Ganbarou Ishinomaki” sign put up shortly after the disaster. It is a reminder for all to “Never Give Up!”, no matter how hard things become.\nHiyoriyama is a hillside park famous for its springtime cherry blossoms and panoramic views. Compare pictures of the town pre-tsunami with the current flattened coastline which is being reconstructed.\nDon't be surprised by the bizarre, UFO-shaped \"Mangattan,\" or Ishinomori Manga Museum. This very striking structure houses characters and original artwork by the \"King of Comics,\" Shotaro Ishinomori, known for Cyborg009 and Kamen Rider.\nJust off the coast is Tashiro Island, better known as \"Cat Island,\" home to more cats than people. Locate the cat shrine in the forest and cat architecture found at the nearby camping site.\n©Miyagi Prefecture\nFor a quieter experience, visit Kinkasan Island for a spiritual journey. Hailed as one of the three holiest places in Tohoku, you'll find forest hiking, temple buildings with much statuary, and a tribe of semi-wild deer, respected as messengers for the gods.\n©Miyagi Prefecture\n### Kesennuma: resilience by the bay\nKesennuma is another town that was hard-hit by the 2011 disaster but is fighting to recover. About two to three hours from Sendai by train, the town is famous for its super-fresh seafood. You can recharge at K-Port, built by the famous actor Ken Watanabe after the tsunami. Indulge in gourmet pizza, curry, pancakes and good coffee.\nNature fans can climb the central 239-meter-high Mt. Anba, or visit nearby Oshima Island and rent a bicycle to tour Mt.

The compact town center of Naruko Onsen welcomes visitors with a mix of craft shops, restaurants, and art galleries. The surrounding mountains offer many pleasant hiking trails, particularly colorful in autumn.\n### Don't Miss\n- Wear a yukata and go hot spring hopping around town\n- Paint a wooden kokeshi doll for a personalized memento\n- Follow in the footsteps of master haiku poet Matsuo Basho on the \"Narrow Road to the Deep North\"\n## How to Get There\nThe Naruko hot spring area can be reached by JR Tohoku Shinkansen from Tokyo with a change at Sendai.\nFrom Tokyo, it takes around 120 minutes to reach Sendai Station by shinkansen. You can transfer to the Yamabiko Shinkansen to Furukawa Station, then take a local JR train to Naruko-Onsen. It takes about one hour from Sendai Station.\nThere are also local trains from Sendai Station, however, bus is the cheapest and easiest way to reach the Naruko area. Take a Miyako highway bus to Naruko Onsen at bus stop number 24 in front of Sendai Station. The journey takes around 90 minutes.\n### Relax and renew the senses\nThe Naruko area is divided into five hot spring regions, but most visitors focus on the central area, simply known as Naruko Onsen.\n### Exploring the town\nThe central part of Naruko is sandwiched between the serene Oyagawa River and thick green forest. Two narrow streets snake through town, lined with small shops, cafes, and restaurants. Most places can only accommodate a few customers at a time, creating an intimate atmosphere.\n### Collectible kokeshi\nThe subtle smiles of wooden kokeshi dolls greet you from the windows of the local shops and craft ateliers. These simple wooden dolls are a traditional souvenir from the Tohoku region. The Naruko kokeshi dolls are characterized by its chrysanthemum patterns and the squeaking sound made when you turn their heads. Try painting your own kokeshi at several shops including Sakurai Kokeshi.\n### Trekking the mountain trails\nThe surrounding mountains offer easy trails and lovely views. The 1.3-kilometer Katanuma lake trail is a flat dirt trail circling a crystal clear lake, where Naruko hot spring water was first discovered during a volcanic eruption in 837. No swimming is allowed, but you can rent boats. Try a delicious \"Genghis Khan\" lunch of grilled lamb at Katanuma Rest House.\n### Steam from the center of the earth\nFeel the heat at Jigokudani (which translates as \"Hell Valley\"), in the Onikobe area. Hellish scenes of steam shooting from the rock walls and boiling water bubbling up from the depths dot an otherwise peaceful stream in the forest. Take the bus from Naruko-Onsen Station to the Onikobe Geyser stop. You can pick up a walking trail to the valley (around 30 minutes) from near the bus stop.\n### Challenging and inspiring paths\nChallenge yourself with a more intense 8.9-kilometer hike on the Oku no Hosomichi trail, which traveling haiku poet Matsuo Basho used in 1689 to traverse Shitomae no Seki and Sakaida in Yamagata Prefecture. Hunt for the historical markers along the way. The hiking trail stretches roughly from Naruko-Onsen Station to Sakaida Station.\nNothing can beat viewing the golden yellow and fiery red leaves that adorn Naruko Gorge each autumn. Several surrounding walking paths and the short trail at the bottom of the gorge offer postcard-worthy views of the bridge and surrounding foliage.\n### Too many baths to choose from\nEnjoying the hot springs is easy. The hard part is choosing from among the 400 options. Most hotels offer public daytime use of the hot springs. You can also find hotels and public bath houses which offer private baths. Around town, you will find free hot spring footbaths, called ashi-no-yu.\n### Hot spring hopping\nWash, soak, and repeat among several smaller and less expensive baths such as local favorites Taki-no-Yu and Waseda Sajiki Yu. Take the opportunity to meet local people and enjoy Japan's onsen culture."}

Known as the \"Springs of Beauty\" for their smoothing effect on skin, bathers over the centuries realized that although the natural hot baths had a strong sulfer smell, they offered several health benefits including relieving skin diseases and lowering high cholesterol and high blood pressure. There are traditional inns with private hot springs as well as public baths and foot baths.\n### Zao in the winter\nZao is famous for the Zao Onsen Ski Resort, which opens from late December to early May.

For the ultimate apres-ski relaxation, unwind in an open-air bath to enjoy the snow while soaking in the heated therapeutic water.\n### Zao's snow monsters\nEach winter a unique natural phenomenon gives birth to juhyo, the famed “snow monsters” of the Zao Mountains. Airborne water droplets freeze to the mountain trees, then snow and more freezing build up these alien forms.\nSki right through the snow monsters on the upper slopes, or take an evening tour of the illuminated snow monsters on the Nightcruiser, a modified snowmobile.\n### Things heat up in the spring\nIn late April, the snow melts enough to reopen the Echo Line to head up to the higher peaks of the Zao Mountains. Until late May, the road is flanked by the amazing site of ten-meter-high walls of snow.\nOutside of winter, hiking becomes the primary activity. Ask anyone in Tohoku and they will recommend Zao Okama for exhilarating hikes and beautiful mountain scenery.\n### Peer into an active volcano\nZao Okama is the caldera of an active volcano. The name comes from its breathtaking lake shaped like an okama, or cooking pot. Accessible by bus from the Yamagata side of Zao, the crater lake is 27 meters deep with a 1,000-meter circumference. You can't walk down to the water's edge, but you can view the lake from a distance.\nThe lake is also known as “lake of five colors.” The water changes color according to the intensity of daylight, ranging from deep emerald to bright turquoise.\n### Run with the foxes\nZao Fox Village located on the Miyagi side of Zao is open all year. One hundred animals and six types of foxes call this mountain retreat home. You'll find foxes freely roaming around, lounging, and pestering you to give them fox snacks sold at the gift shop."}

Along the coast sit the port cities of Tsuruoka and Sakata, while deep inland is Zao Onsen, an area home to hot springs, sparsely visited ski slopes, and spectacular snow-covered evergreens. Mountain temple Yamadera is the subject of one of the most famous haiku poems, and Ginzan Onsen is a picturesque hot spring resort town on the site of a former silver mine.\n## How to Get There\nYamagata Prefecture is accessible via bullet train from Tokyo. Alternatively, you can fly to Yamagata Airport or Shonai Airport.\nThe JR Yamagata Shinkansen serves Yamagata and connects much of the prefecture with Tokyo. It takes 3 hours to reach the northern terminus at Shinjo.

A long wooden cylindrical body is topped with a round head and then both sections are hand-painted in red and black by the artisan.\n- Imoni\nImoni is a beef and vegetable stew common in Yamagata Prefecture. Imoni combines thin slices of beef, taro root, konnyaku, green onions and various seasonal ingredients in a giant iron kettle. The ingredients are slowly cooked in a sweetened soy sauce broth. If in the Yamagata area, don't miss out on this quintessential comfort food.\n- Akebi\nThe harvest season for Akebi is from late August to mid-October. Known as the Princess of the Mountains, this fruit with its deep purple hues has some sweetness, but is mostly known for its color.\n- Obanazawa Watermelon\nLarge swings in temperature between night and day in Yamagata give these watermelons a higher sugar content and great sweetness. Obanazawa watermelon shows up in wine, soda and various sweets.\n- Yamagata Cherries\nCherries were introduced to Yamagata in 1876, and the prefecture now produces 70 percent of all Japan's cherries. Yamagata cherries are large, juicy and very sweet, and have a long shelf life.\n- Yonezawa Beef\nOne of the three main brands of Japanese beef, the rich flavor and marbling of Yonezawa beef is the result of a long-term fattening method in which cows are raised on a diet of rice straw.\n- Uetsu Tilia-Bark Textiles\nUetsu shinafu is one of Japan’s three oldest textiles. Plainly textured, durable and water-resistant, this fabric made perfect workwear. Today, precious tilia-bark cloth is fashioned into accessories, including hats and obi sashes.\n- Tendo Japanese Chess Pieces\nA player’s rank determines moves in shogi, the Japanese version of chess. With similar shapes, kanji lettering make tendo shogi koma identifiable. Craftsmen put their stamp on game board pieces with detailed engraving, embossed lacquer and calligraphic style.\n- Yamagata Ironware\nYamagato imono is cast metalware using techniques dating back to the 6th century. Precision sand casting is used to produce these refined patterns, textures and exact shapes. These time-honored skills are used to make a variety of ironware utensils, most notably chagama—Japanese tea ceremony kettles.\n## Seasonal Highlights\n- Spring\nCherry blossom blooms are particularly beautiful in Kajo Park in Yamagata City and Tsukioka Park, with Kaminoyama Castle in the background.\n- Summer\nSummer is the best time to taste the area’s prized cherries or pick them yourself in Higashine. Join the locals in numerous events held across the prefecture, such as the massive Hanagasa Festival.\n- Autumn\nFestivals continue into fall with harvest-related events like the Imoni-kai potato festival. Leaves start to change color in late September, attracting hikers to eastern Yamagata's picturesque mountain gorges.\n- Winter\nSki, snowshoe, see towering evergreens covered in hoarfrost or retreat from the cold at a traditional hot spring resort. Yamagata remains lively in winter even when covered in snow."}

With a five-story pagoda listed as a National Treasure and a shrine with one of the thickest thatched roofs in Japan, it's an ideal spot to find peace and tranquility as you wander through a forest filled with cedar trees that are 350 to 600 years old.\nAt Mt. Yudono, you can experience the training of the ascetic monks of the mountains by donning a type of all-white religious attire called shiro-shozoku and participating in waterfall ablutions and walking on hot coals.\n### Chill out at Kamo Aquarium\nWithin Tsuruoka City is Kamo Aquarium, with sharks, crabs, sea lions and more. The real draw, though, is its massive jellyfish collection, which earned Kamo a place in the Guinness Book of World Records.\nThere are over 60 varieties of jellyfish displayed in backlit tanks that create a visually compelling and captivating atmosphere. They even serve jellyfish ice cream here if you're looking to try something different.\n### A glimpse of traditional Japan at Somaro Maiko Teahouse\nThe Somaro Maiko Teahouse reflects the luxury and ambiance of a time when Sakata hosted sailors and merchants traveling between Yamagata and Kyoto. It offers a very traditional Japanese experience featuring maiko—geisha in training—who will sing and dance for you while you enjoy green tea and wagashi, Japanese sweets.\n### Drink some award-winning sake\nBe sure to stop by the Oyama sake-brewing district in Tsuruoka, which is home to four award-winning sake breweries. Free sake tastings at the Oyama New Sake & Brewery Festival in early February, which celebrates the brewery's latest batch.\n### History, culture and breathtaking gardens\nThe Honma Museum, housed in an old villa, was Japan's first postwar art gallery. You can enjoy Japanese green tea in a traditional Japanese setting and view art both contemporary and traditional.\nThe museum's beautiful landscape garden, with picturesque Mt. Chokai in the background, has been designated a National Place of Scenic Beauty for its visual harmony between buildings and nature.\nAlso stop by the Ken Domon Museum of Photography, which displays some 70,000 photographs from the iconic cameraman best known for his inspiring postwar photography.\nNear the town of Yuza is another natural attraction known as Maru Pond. The pond is famous for its transparent, almost glowing emerald-green water.\n### Stone guardians and spectacular sunsets at Juroku Raken Iwa\nThe Juroku Rakan Iwa (Buddhist Carvings) at Yuza is a collection of 22 stone Buddhist images dedicated to those lost at sea. Local stonemasons carved them into the seaside rock outcropping 150 years ago at the urging of a local monk. The monks look out across the sea and wish the sailors and fishermen of northern Japan good fortune and safe travels.\nOn clear days, you can also see the island of Tobishima 40 kilometers out. This is also one of the best spots in the prefecture to enjoy the sun setting over the Sea of Japan."}

Hoshu just 25 minutes from the city.

Zao, its four public baths are open for guests to drop in for a soak.\nWhen you're finished, head up to Kaminoyama Castle, for views over the town and surrounding mountains.

Today it houses a small museum paying homage to the warlords that once ruled the region.\n### Dedicated to fruit, hot springs, and games\nTendo is Yamagata's fruit mecca, home to vast orchards of apples, peaches, pears, and of course, cherries. It's also one of the prefecture's premier hot spring resorts, with many outdoor baths.\nFor fans of shogi, Japanese chess, the town produces the vast majority of Japan's game pieces. Their creation is a highly developed local craft dating back hundreds of years.\n### World class skiing and snow monsters\nMt. Zao is one of the most popular sightseeing spots in northern Japan, with great hiking in the summer, top-notch skiing at the Zao Onsen Ski Resort in the winter and sigh-inducing soaks at its eponymous onsen, which operates year-round.\nMt. Zao is also home to a phenomenon known as “snow monsters,” where trees on the upper slopes take on eerie shapes due to being covered with heavy snow and blasted by Siberian winds.\nThis area of the mountain is accessible via chairlift and gondola, and the trees are illuminated at night. You can also take in the views from the warmth of a café if the temperature seems daunting. The snow monsters are at their most ferocious in mid-February."}

Rich in history, Yonezawa is also known for traditional cloth weaving, sake brewing, and nationally renowned beef.\n### Don't Miss\n- The Yonezawa Castle ruins, located in the heart of the city\n- The intense re-enactment of the Kawanakajima battle held at the annual Uesugi Festival\n## How to Get There\nThe quickest way to get to Yonezawa is via the JR Yamagata Shinkansen Line, which departs hourly from Tokyo Station to Yonezawa Station.\nThe journey by shinkansen takes around two and a half hours. Traveling by air from Tokyo is another viable option, as the price is only slightly more than that of a shinkansen ticket. Flight times vary, so it's best to check ahead of time if you plan to take this route.\n### Dedicated to the war god\nIn the heart of the city lie the ruins of Yonezawa Castle, with rows of old houses and a traditional samurai residence, alongside the Uesugi Shrine dedicated to the distinguished warrior Uesugi Kenshin.\nNext to Uesugi Shrine is Keishoden Memorial Hall. It is the perfect place for history buffs looking to learn more about the “war god” Uesugi Kenshin. There are mementos of Uesugi and his descendants, along with 131 important cultural properties and 1,000 items from throughout the Edo era.\nIn February, the shrine features a festival of lights, with 300 snow lanterns and 1,000 individual snow lamps creating an other-worldly sight. Food stalls and souvenir shops sell locally crafted goods around the shrine.\n### Relax in an atmospheric hot spring\nIn the 700-year-old historic hot spring village of Shirabu, the thatched roofs of the Japanese inns will transport you back in time. Numerous hot springs inns offer travelers the chance to relax, unwind and soak in the warm, soothing waters throughout the year.\n### Hike in the Tengendai Highlands\nOnly a few bus stops away from Shirabu Onsen and a 6-minute ropeway ride to an altitude of 1,300 meters, you'll find the refreshing air of the Tengendai highlands.\nFrom here, you can enjoy some of the best views in Yonezawa, whether you're visiting during the colorful autumn season, or in winter, when the region is blanketed in heavy snow. Trekking through the highlands, you'll find shimmering waterfalls and remote shrines waiting to be discovered.\nFrom grass skiing and mountain biking in summer to skiing and snowboarding during the winter, the Tengendai highlands are a popular spot for outdoor sports no matter the weather.\n### Delicious and powerful festivals\nBe sure to attend the Yonezawa Beef Festival during the first week of August, where hundreds of locals gather to taste the highest quality Japanese beef in Tohoku, deliciously cooked over a hot barbeque.\nFrom late April to early May, the annual Uesugi Festival sees the re-enactment of the Kawanakajima Battle, one of the largest battles to take place during the Warring States period in the 16th century, when 700 men, the contingents of the Uesugi and Takeda armies, clashed in combat. Everyone is encouraged to participate, and it's a great opportunity to try Samurai armor and go into battle."}

The distinct aroma will guide you to the yubatake—literally translated as hot water field — in the center of town. Geothermal water rises to the surface straight from the source and is cooled as it runs along a series of connected wooden chutes while maintaining the natural mineral content.\nHot steam billows as the water gushes down into the emerald reservoir. Kusatsu Onsen has the largest amount of naturally occurring hot spring water in Japan.\nWith high temperatures (around 55 degrees Celsius) and high acidity, the water is said to cure many conditions and is especially good for your skin. Several Tokugawa shoguns had the water transported in barrels to their castle in Edo (now Tokyo).\n### Hot spring traditions\nFrom the yubatake, you can easily stroll to Netsunoyu hall to watch the yumomi performance. Onsen workers cool the water by dipping and turning wooden planks, churning the water to the rhythm of a folk song.\n### Strolling and shopping\nTake the narrow alley near the Netsunoyu and explore the quaint arts and crafts shops, featuring milky glass inspired by the waters. Be sure to try onsen manju (steamed sweet buns) and onsen tamago (eggs boiled in the hot springs). You can follow the alley all the way to Sainokawara Park, an area where steamy hot spring water gushes naturally.\n## Keywords"}

From there, transfer to the Keikyu Airport Line bound for Haneda Airport. Journeys from Shinagawa can take up to 30 minutes.\nBy monorail: Departing from JR Hamamatsucho Station, also on the Yamanote Line, the Tokyo Monorail provides a scenic seaside journey to Haneda Airport. Airport Express services take as little as 13 minutes.\nBy bus: A number of limousine buses service Haneda Airport from major train stations and hotels in the greater Tokyo area.\nBy taxi: Various providers offer flat-rate taxi services to and from Haneda Airport. Late-night services and expressway surcharges cost extra.\nWhen planning your journey, be aware that public transport in Tokyo doesn't run 24 hours.

Early morning bus services from the center of Tokyo and Yokohama start arriving around 4:30. For late-night arrivals, the last trains and buses into the city end just after midnight.\n### Haneda's history\nHaneda Airport opened as Tokyo Haneda Airfield in 1931. The airfield was centrally located in the country and served scheduled domestic flights and goodwill flights. In 1978 most international flights were relocated to the newly constructed Narita Airport, and Haneda became a domestic airport. However, the number of air passengers and airlines has been increasing, and Haneda has expanded to accommodate the growing demand for air travel. In 2010 the airport's international terminal, Terminal 3, was opened. There are also plans for a new train line to open that connects Tokyo Station and Haneda in around 18 minutes.\n### Airlines at Haneda\nAll Nippon Airways (ANA), Japan Airlines (JAL) and many other domestic and international airlines operate flights to and from Haneda.\n### What to do when you're not flying\nAs the busiest airport in Japan (and one of the top five busiest in the world), Haneda has everything you'd expect from a modern domestic and international airport.

To enhance the effect, Edo Alley is accessed by crossing a replica of Nihonbashi, the historic center point of all roads in Japan. If you're in Terminal 1, look for Haneda's own aviation shrine and pray for a safe flight.\nFor more modern Japan, visit Tokyo Pop Town, which stocks a wide array of anime, manga, and character merchandise. Or consider renting a \"Robohon\" for a robot guided tour.\n### Accommodation\nFor flights arriving or departing outside of public transport hours, or if you just want to rest up, accommodations are available in each terminal.\nTerminal 3 (the international terminal) and Terminal 2 both offer standard hotel accommodations, while Terminal 1 has the first-class-themed compact hotel First Cabin on site for a comfortable sleeping experience.\nTravelers can stay at one of the accommodation options in and around Otorii and Anamori-Inari stations on the Keikyu Airport Line, many of which offer free shuttle buses for guests.\n## Keywords"}

Zao Onsen is known for its mineral rich water which helps to relieve fatigue and beautify the skin, and is also a famous ski resort during the snowy season. The healing waters are said to have been discovered in 110 AD.\nZao offers a wide range of experiences throughout the year. In the green season, you can go hiking, cycling, trekking and mountain climbing, or enjoy forest bathing.\n### Don't Miss\n- Skiing, snowboarding and apres-ski in winter\n- Enjoying Zao's Juhyo \"snow monster\" festival\n- Forest bathing and trekking in green season\n## How to Get There\nZao Onsen is accessed most easily from the Yamagata Prefecture side via a 40-minute bus that departs hourly from Yamagata Station.\nFrom Sendai Station, take the Senzan Line one hour and 15 minutes to Yamagata Station to board the bus.\n### Enjoying the slopes\nThe ski resort is renowned for the number and quality of its runs, and both day and night skiing are options. Zao's famous icons, snow monsters, are trees coated with ice and snow that take on a surreal appearance, a rare winter phenomenon\nThe Zao area is also a popular destination for hikers and climbers during the autumn and summer months. There are various courses suitable for anyone from beginners to experienced climbers. There are also walking courses through wetlands and volcanic regions.\nZao is an ideal place for walking among the trees for forest bathing. This has been scientifically proven to boost the immune system and lower blood pressure, among other benefits.\n### Healing sore, tired muscles, by bathing\nZao's hot springs have high levels of sulfur said to be beneficial for muscle pains, chronic skin diseases, high cholesterol and high blood pressure.\nSoaking in these acidic hot springs—which also contain high levels of aluminum, sulfate, chloride and iron—has beautifying effects as well. The water is known to rejuvenate and strengthen both skin and blood vessels, giving you a more youthful and healthy appearance. This is why Zao Onsen is also known as the “Springs of Beauty.”\nChoose from among dozens of hot springs during your visit. Most hotels or ryokan (Japanese style inns) have their own hot springs for guests. There are day-trip bathing facilities and public baths for day visitors.\nThe Tourist Information Center can provide more information and locations of the hot springs. In total, there are five facilities offering day visits in the area, three public hot springs, and three-foot baths.\nDay-use hot springs are a little more expensive, but well equipped. Genshichi and Zao Onsen open-air spas offer hot spring experiences in a natural setting.

Zao Fox Village is a one-of-a-kind forest inhabited by foxes, that visitors can walk through.\nView the foxes ambling about or relaxing, hear them sing their distinct fox call, and even have your chance to feed and cuddle them.\n### Don't Miss\n- Take lots of photos of the foxes, but take heed of the safety warnings\n- Feed the animals at a special feeding area. (only available on weekends and public holidays)\n- There are two sessions a day when you can hold a fox\n## How to Get There\nReach Zao Fox Village by train or bus, combined with taxi or shuttle bus services.\nFrom Tokyo, take the Tohoku Shinkansen to Shiroishi-Zao station.\nAlternatively, take the train or highway bus to Sendai. From Sendai, you can take the local JR train direct to Shiroishi Station (45 minutes). From both stations, you will have to take either a taxi or shuttle bus to reach Fox Village, the latter being much more economical unless you are in a group.\n### Safety is paramount\nWhile the foxes might look cute and tame, they are still semi-wild. Pay attention to the staff members when they explain the rules as you enter. Touching the animals is not allowed, and the foxes cannot be given food outside the feeding area.\nKeep moving in the main enclosure. If you are standing still, curious foxes may bite at your shoes and trousers. In some cases, foxes have died from accidentally swallowing items.\n### A veritable menagerie\nWhile foxes are the main attraction, Zao Fox Village is home to more than just foxes. Greet the miniature ponies, and interact with goats and bunnies. For an additional fee, there is an opportunity to cuddle a fox, twice a day. If you're lucky, you might even get to hold a fox cub in late spring.\n### A village unlike any other\nWith no time limit to your wandering around Zao Fox Village, you can leisurely watch the foxes and focus on trying to get the perfect snapshot. Foxes roam around between the rocky and grassy edges of the enclosure or the concentrated center of small wooden huts and platforms where they like to sleep.\n### Pilgrimage to Inari Shrine\nThere are many folktales, myths, and legends about foxes in Japan. Particularly, foxes are believed to be able to transform into humans and like to play tricks.\nTry to make peace with these cheeky creatures by visiting the village's red Inari Shrine flanked by two fox statues. About one-third of the shrines in Japan are considered shrines dedicated to Inari Okami, the Shinto deity of prosperity, fertility, and rice. The messenger of this deity is the fox.\n### After your visit\nBefore leaving, you have a chance to purchase fox character souvenirs at the shop. If you want to explore the area further, combine your visit with a trip to Shiraishi to visit a sake brewery, a doll museum and the reconstructed Shiraishi Castle.\nIf you want to explore the area further, consider combining your visit with a trip to Shiroishi City where you will find a sake brewery, doll museum, and the reconstructed Shiroishi Castle.\n## Keywords"}

Zao is one of Tohoku's most prominent mountains. Within the mountain lies Okama Crater, a breathtaking caldera lake famous for its changes in color. The deep, water-filled crater is similar in shape (though not in size) to an “okama” cooking pot, thus giving the volcano its name.\n### Don't Miss\n- The changing colors of the caldera lake\n- Alpine flowers in spring\n- Autumn leaves on the slopes of Mt. Zao\n## How to Get There\nReach Mt. Zao by rental car or public transport from both Miyagi and Yamagata prefectures. Note, however, that the crater lake is not accessible during winter (usually early November through late April) due to heavy snowfall.\nFrom Miyagi:\nMt. Zao is located about 60 kilometers from Sendai. If arriving by train from Tokyo, take the JR Tohoku Shinkansen to Shiroishi-Zao Station. One bus a day, available on weekends and public holidays, will take you on the 100 minute trip to Zao-Katta Sancho. From here, walk five minutes to the mountain's viewing platform.\nIf arriving by car, use the Miyagi Prefecture side of the Zao Echo Line and drive to the parking lot just below Mt. Kattadake. The drive should take only under 90 minutes. From there, walk a few minutes to the viewing platform above the lake.\nFrom Yamagata:\nIf using public transport, board a train bound for Kaminoyama at JR Yamagata Station. Upon your arrival, use the free shuttle bus to the Katta parking area; the journey takes an hour. Take the Zao-Katta ski lift and then walk a few minutes to get to the viewing platform.\nIf arriving by car, use the Yamagata Prefecture side of the Zao Echo Line and drive to the parking lot just below Mt. Kattadake. From there, walk a few minutes to the viewing platform.\nAlternatively, if you are spending time in Zao Onsen and want a hike before hitting the hot springs, take the Zao Ropeway to the upper station and hike 45 minutes to reach Zao Okama's crater lake.\nNote: The bus to Zao Onsen is separate from the bus that goes to the caldera, but it also departs from Yamagata Station.\n### Hike to the top for the best views\nAny trip to Mt. Zao is incomplete without a visit to Zao Okama. You can scale most of the mountain by car, bus, ropeway, or chairlift and have the choice of a five or 45-minute hike to the top of the mountain.\nThe lake is situated at the top of Mt. Zao, one of the most recognizable peaks in the Tohoku region, at 1,841 meters tall. The crater lake is 27 meters deep and has a circumference of 1,000 meters. The high acidity of the water means no animals can live in or drink the water. Visitors can view the lake from a distance.\nAnother nickname for Okama Crater is Goshikinuma or the Lake of Five Colors. The water changes color according to the intensity of daylight. Various shades of deep green and blue are the norm, but if you are lucky, you will be welcomed with a brilliant emerald or turquoise hue.\n### See it at its prime\nOkama Crater is closed during the winter months, while the remaining months each offer something special.\nDuring the summer months, the mountain comes alive with the flowers of alpine plants. View the fiery yellows, oranges, and reds of autumn leaves from late September to late October.\nThe 26-kilometer Echo Line is opened toward the end of April. At this time, the road is clear of snow, but the banks either side have up to ten meters of snow stacked from the long winter. Enjoy this awesome sight before the snow melts in mid-May.\n### Safety first\nMt. Zao is one of over 100 active volcanoes in Japan. Over the last few centuries, there has been some seismic activity, but no eruptions have occurred. The government continues to monitor the area with four observation posts and field tests. Meanwhile, regular and evacuation planning is carried out in case an eruption does take place. Needless to say exercise caution and good judgment and look up official advice before heading to the mountain.\nHikers are much more likely to experience common hazards associated with the outdoors. Be aware of wildlife, wear appropriate gear, stay hydrated and protect yourself from the sun.\n## Keywords"}

Boats usually run once an hour or once every thirty minutes during the high season between April and August.\n### A place where dreams come true\nAlternatively, at the gorge turning point, head to the rock formation shaped like a lion's nose—it's where the gorge derived its name. You can buy five lucky stones for 100 yen, representing either love, long life, luck, destiny, wealth, relationships, or your own wish. If you manage to throw your stone or stones into the opening at the opposing cliff face across the gorge, your dreams are supposed to come true.\n### Geibikei through the seasons\nThe boats run all year round. However, the busiest time is in the fall when the leaves change color. Surrounded by snow-capped mountains, winter is no less impressive.

Unfortunately, due to saltwater poisoning, the tree eventually died. It was cut down in 2012, and through the generous donations from around the world the tree was preserved and returned to its original place to stand as a symbol of hope and perseverance for the people of Rikuzentakata.\n### Other things to do in the area\nYou will probably need two or three hours to see all of the Goishi Coast. Head north after that to Kamaishi and the northern part of Sanriku Fukko Park. Kamaishi has a rich tradition of rugby and is one of the host cities for the 2019 Rugby World Cup.\n## Keywords"}

If you'd like to take Ryusendo Cave water to go, its bottled spring water is a popular souvenir.\n### Beating the summer heat\nFar underground, Ryusendo Cave provides a naturally air-conditioned adventure during the sweltering Japanese summer. In fact, the temperature of the cave doesn't vary much year-round, making it quite comfortable in the winter as well.\n### Things to do near Ryusendo Cave\nAfter returning to the surface, you can walk across the street to Ryusen Shindo, a less expansive cave which houses a small science museum with displays on cavern geology and information on the area. It typically takes about an hour to see both caves.\nAfter you've finished your underground exploration, you can head up to the spectacular Kitayamazaki Coast, or down to Miyako's stunning Jodogahama Beach.\nYou can also stay in Iwaizumi and climb Mt. Ureira. This takes about half a day. The climb is easy and suitable for those of average fitness and the views are amazing.\n## Keywords"}

The concept is to experience artworks that blend in with the surrounding cityscape and nature.\n### Don't Miss\n- Exhibits outside the museum blending with the surrounding city\n- Erwin Wurm's unique work, \"Fat House\"\n- The strikingly modern architecture of the museum building\n## How to Get There\nShichinohe-Towada is the second of three Tohoku Shinkansen stops in Aomori from Tokyo. It is primarily a gateway to Towada City and the lake area. There, you can change to buses for Towada.\nTowada is in the foothills of the Hakkoda Mountains, and includes the Aomori side of Lake Towada. There are no trains in the Towada area, but the Towada Kanko Electric Railway operates buses every one to two hours from Shichinohe-Towada. Around half of the buses go directly to the Towada Art Center, while the other half go to the city center, which is around a 10-minute walk to the museum.\n### Encountering art in unexpected places\nMost of the pieces in the museum's permanent collection—there are only around 30 works—were commissioned especially for Towada Art Center. In addition, there are seven works in the public \"Art Square\" and six more called \"Street Furniture.\"\nDespite the relatively small number of pieces, there is a great deal to see and do. Most of the works that are housed inside the museum are in spaces designed especially for them. The building's architecture, designed by architect Ryue Nishizawa, is perfectly matched to the installations, but his design actually encompasses the whole street block.\nPhoto: Oyamada Kuniya\n### See the worlds of world-famous artists\nMany of the works commissioned for the Arts Towada Project are by famous artists such as Yoko Ono, Ron Mueck and Jeong Hwa Choi. But the name recognition of the artists themselves is really secondary here. You'll be in awe walking through and among the exhibits. Sitting on the \"street furniture\", you'll feel like a child again. It's almost more like a park than a museum.\nPhoto: Kitamura Mitsutaka\n### There really isn't another museum like it\nThe old main street, Kanchogaidori, (literally “street of government offices”) had become deserted due to population decline. The city and this art project have been largely successful in changing that. The Art Center has not only attracted attention and awards, but an influx of tourism has rejuvenated the city. It has become a source of pride.\n### While you're there\nLake Towada is around one hour away, and some parts of Oirase Stream are also within an hour by car or bus.\n## Keywords"}

Hiking or biking along it, you'll see why the stream and the gorge have inspired painters and poets for centuries.\nThe area is full of lush woods, waterfalls and odd outcroppings of rocks. Examples of the latter two have even acquired names over the years.\n### Don't Miss\n- The impressive drop of Choshi Falls\n- A stroll across Deaibashi (Hook-up Bridge)\n- The vibrant fall colors of Oirase Gorge\n## How to Get There\nOirase Gorge is most easily reached by JR bus from either Aomori or Hachinohe stations. Please note service is suspended in winter.\nFrom either station, you'll take the bus bound for Towada-ko. There are numerous bus stops, such as Yakeyama, from which the trailhead can be reached. Choose where to disembark based on what you want to see, and how long you want to hike.\n### Wander along 14 kilometers of bliss\nThe best ways to experience the stream are by hiking or cycling along its banks. Walking lets you fully absorb the details of your surroundings. Figure on five hours to walk the whole route, or more, if you sketch, take photos or write poetry.\nIf you decide to cycle, you can rent a bike in Yakeyama and ride it one way, dropping it off in Nenokuchi at the far end of the path.\nAlong the way, you'll see waterfalls with fanciful names like Soryu (Two Dragons), Tomoshiraga (Life-Long Partnership) and Shirakinu (White Silk).\n### Walking meditation and forest bathing\nSome people say that walking here is like meditation. The virgin beech, Japanese oak, maple, and white cedar trees breathe with you. The whole concept of forest therapy focuses on that magical interaction.\nIn late October, the turning of the leaves will take your breath away. In the snowy winter season, some of the falls may even freeze over, but the stream continues to flow. The area turns lush and green in spring and summer.\n### A word on the name\nThis area is known by several names in the guidebooks. This is a matter of translation and of emphasis. Depending on where you look, you'll see the area referred to as Oirase Gorge, Oirase Stream and Oirase Mountain Stream. They are all the same idyllic place.\n### After the trail\nSetting out from Yakeyama, the end of the trail is at Lake Towada in Nenokuchi. If you're still up for more adventure, Nenokuchi offers activities like fishing and sightseeing cruises on the lake. Or, after all the exercise, you might prefer to relax at a restaurant and sample dishes of kokanee salmon and Japanese smelt caught in Lake Towada.\n## Keywords"}

There are also flights from Tokyo's Haneda Airport to Aomori Airport and highway buses between Tokyo and Hirosaki.\nFrom Hirosaki Station, it is a 15-minute bus ride to the Shiyakusho Mae bus stop. If you walk, it is around 30 minutes from the station to Hirosaki Park.\nThe festival is all around the Hirosaki Park area by the castle.\n### One of Japan's top snow festivals\nThe Hirosaki Castle Snow Lantern Festival is filled with many activities both for day and night.\nIn the Hirosaki, there is a big snow statue. At night, there is a projection mapping display on the statue. The Tsugaru-Nishiki-e Cloister is another highlight—a pair of walls that display the fronts and backs of Neputa Matsuri fans.\nAt night, the fans are lit up, just like during the summer Neputa festival. While the scale of the neputa is much smaller than on the summer floats, you can get a real sense of the energy and color of the Hirosaki Neputa Matsuri.\n### For family fun\nThe playground has games and two large snow slides. On one of the evenings of the festival, there is a fireworks show. In Japan, nearly all fireworks events are in the summer, so this is a rare treat.\nYou can also find other snow sculptures, lit paths, and food stalls in the park.

Constructed in the Hirayama style, the main tower was built on top of a hill for easier defense and surrounded by defensive walls, moats, and yagura towers. The park surrounding the castle is filled with cherry trees, making spring here a major event.\n### Don't Miss\n- Castle grounds—the moats, gates, and turrets, as well as about 2,600 cherry trees\n- Repairs of the stone castle walls—until around 2025, renovations will give you a rare chance to see how Japanese castles are built\n- Aomori apple pie—Aomori's most famous fruit prepared just right\n## How to Get There\nThe castle is about 30 minutes south by express train from Shin-Aomori to Hirosaki Station. Hirosaki Castle is easily accessible from Hirosaki Station.\nYou can walk around 30 minutes to the castle grounds or take a bus (15 minutes) to the Shiyakusho-mae bus stop. Hirosaki is the regional commercial center of southwest Aomori Prefecture and the center of its apple production area.\n### One of Japan's iconic castles\nThe castle was originally built in 1611 by Nobuhira, lord of the Tsugaru clan. Lord Tsugaru sided with the great warlord Toyotomi Hideyoshi in the Battle of Odawara that reunited Japan and with Tokugawa Ieyasu in the Battle of Sekigahara, which ushered in Japan's longest samurai government.\nThe Hirosaki Castle \"keep\" was originally a five-story tower. In 1627, it was struck by lightning and burned down. The current structure was rebuilt in 1811 as a three-story tower.\n### One of the few originals\nAlmost all Japanese castles were dismantled after 1868 when samurai rule came to an end or burnt down in World War II. Many of the castles you see in Japan today were rebuilt after the war. In Tohoku, Hirosaki Castle is the only castle that was built during the Edo Period (1603-1867). In 2006, Hirosaki Castle was listed by the Japan Castle Foundation as one of the \"100 Fine Castles of Japan.\"\nMany faces of Hirosaki Castle\n### Center of Hirosaki culture and history\nJapanese castles are not just their buildings. The grounds are home to some important cultural events. The Snow Lantern Festival, Hirosaki Cherry Blossom Festival, and Hirosaki Neputa Festival are all held on the park grounds or very close by.\n### Hirosaki Castle Snow Lantern Festival\nHeld in the middle of winter, this festival features hundreds of snow lanterns, small sculptures, and projection mapping that illuminates the beauty of the castle.\n### Hirosaki Cherry Blossom Festival\nWith around 2,600 cherry trees, petal-filled moats, rowboats for rent, picnic areas, night lighting and thousands of revelers, as well as Hirosaki Castle as the backdrop, it's easy to see why Hirosaki Park is considered one of Japan's best cherry blossom spots.\n### Hirosaki Neputa Matsuri\nThe huge fan-shaped Neputa floats are the highlight of the lively summer festival held in the castle town of Hirosaki. The giant floats, drummers, and dancers parade around town, with Hirosaki Castle overlooking the festivities.\n### Easily accessible and scalable\nMany of Japan's castles are built on high ground. Hirosaki Castle, however, is built on a flat plain. In addition, with only three stories, the steep stairs of the keep are much more easily scaled than those of five-story castle towers.\nYou will get to peek through the narrow turrets for shooting arrows and see the beautifully decorated gabled roof of the castle while looking down on the park and the whole of Hirosaki below.\n### Closed in winter\nThe castle keep is closed during much of the winter, from November 24 until mid-April. If you are there during the winter months, you'll still be able to enjoy the views from below and of the castle grounds. If you plan well, you can still see the Snow Lantern Festival or the cherry blossoms.\n## Keywords"}

It is barely on a path. It is an oasis of tranquility rarely found in today's connected age.\n### Don't Miss\n- The tranquility of disconnecting from the outside world\n- Hot springs with stunning natural views\n- Simple yet delicious food\n## How to Get There\nAoni Onsen is located in a very remote location east of Hirosaki. A combination of train and bus travel with multiple changes is necessary.\nBegin your journey at the Konan Railway Hirosaki Station (not the JR station of the same name) and take the train to Kuroishi Station. There, take the Konan Bus bound for Nurukawa and alight at Nijino Park. From there, take the Aoni shuttle bus to Aoni Onsen. Expect the total journey to take around two hours overall.\n### Lamp-no-yado\nWith only one place to stay in the area, Aoni Onsen is popularly known as \"Lamp-no-yado,\" or the lamp inn, the name of the only ryokan. Appropriately named, the inn and hot springs are lit only by oil lamps.\nA testament to the onsen retreat's remote location, the facility didn't have electricity until relatively recently. But despite this recent development, the owners of the inn continue to light the premises exclusively by lamps.\nThere are no TVs, fridge, or even electrical outlets in the guest rooms. Your phone will not work, and you will not be able to connect to the Internet. You will be well and truly off the grid.\n### The true meaning of verdant\nThe mountain stream next to the inn flows from the Minami Hakkoda mountain range and the inn and multiple bathhouses are surrounded by virgin forest. In summer, the surroundings radiate with a fresh, vibrant green.\n### Understated luxury\nThe best reason to visit Aoni Onsen is to relearn the value of doing nothing. A deliciously simple meal, made with fresh local vegetables, wild mountain vegetables, and seafood is prepared with mineral-rich spring water.\n### The baths\nThere are four baths with differing characteristics at Aoni Onsen.\nKenroku-no-yu is an indoor bath with a sunken tub made of hiba wood, a conifer native to Japan with antibacterial properties and a therapeutic aroma.\nTakimi-no-yu, also indoor, looks out onto a splendid waterfall.\nUchiyu is the newest addition to the baths of Aoni Onsen. Like Kenroku-no-yu, the tub and building also use hiba wood. Because it is still relatively new, the scent in this bath remains strong and invigorating.\nThe fourth onsen is an open-air bath, known as a rotenburo. It is a stone bath in a traditional garden setting.\nWhile the three indoor baths are segregated, the outdoor spring is for mixed bathing. However, there are two one-hour slots when it is reserved exclusively for women.\n### Room with a view\nThere are a variety of rooms to stay in at Aoni Onsen. All are Japanese style, with futon, zabuton floor cushions, and other traditional touches. The inn is extremely quaint but surprisingly large—up to 100 guests can be accommodated at any one time.\nIn the room, you will find yukata, towel, and toothbrush, but there is no shampoo or conditioner, so you'll need to bring your own or \"make do.\" As for a hair dryer, even if you bring one, you won't find an outlet for it. You will have to resort to old-school towel drying.\n### Pro Tips\n- The owners allow non-staying guests to use the baths for a small fee and offer day-trip packages that include lunch.\n- If you can, stay for two nights. Almost everyone stays just one night, departing in the morning. During the day, you'll practically have the baths to yourself.\n- Don't attempt driving in winter when the snow is heavy and the roads are treacherous.\n## Keywords"}

Attracting millions of visitors, the spectacle is held annually between August 2-7. If you can't make it to the festival, visit Nebuta Museum to experience this matsuri year-round.\n### Don't Miss\n- Discover the meticulously detailed Nebuta floats\n- Learn about the festival's 300-year history\n- Take on the role of a Nebuta Festival dancer (haneto), and try taiko drumming\n## How to Get There\nThe Nebuta Museum is located right next to Aomori Station in Aomori's central waterfront district.\nGetting to Aomori from Tokyo takes just under four hours on the bullet train. Take the Hayabusa Shinkansen to Shin-Aomori and change to the Ou Main Line bound for Aomori. The museum is a two-minute walk from the station.\n### View the floats up close\nWhile the atmosphere of the Nebuta Festival is an undeniably incredible experience, it can be difficult to properly see the parade when you're one of more than three million revelers jostling for space.\nAt the Nebuta Museum, you can not only see the floats up close, but you can also touch them—some displays are actual floats from the previous years' festivals. Take your time to admire these impressive objects and feel free to snap photos of this one-of-a-kind art form.\n### Feeling festive\nA visit to the museum allows further hands-on opportunities such as dancing to the music that accompanies the festival, just like a haneto dancer. Look for the taiko drums that you can play, similar to the festival floats.\nOn weekends and holidays, see experienced Nebuta performers play flutes and taiko drums, accompanied by dancers recreating the lively festival atmosphere. The performers will invite you to join in, teaching you all of the haneto dance steps.\nElsewhere in the museum, try your hand at painting a classic Nebuta face, or learn how to apply washi paper to the giant floats' wire and wood frames.\n### See how the Nebuta floats are made\nThe main hall is where the floats from previous years are displayed. Viewed up close, the giant scale and intricate detail of the floats is jaw-dropping and the smaller displays show the technical work involved in float creation that is otherwise difficult to grasp. Feel free to touch the wire frames and washi paper exteriors, exactly the same as those found on the actual lanterns themselves.\nThe lighting in the museum is kept dim for authenticity, so you can see how the floats are lit up in the actual nighttime parade.\n### Walking through Aomori history\nWalking through the museum's \"Aomori Nebuta Tunnel\" is not only an incredible experience on its own, but it also offers a fascinating journey through the festival's 300-year history. Here, you can see the changes in the techniques and styles of float construction, the parade route, and the growth of the event itself through various historical displays.\n### Special previews\nHoused in white tents (called Nebutagoya) near the museum are the workshops for the in-progress floats. With convenient viewing windows, see the different stages of lantern construction and work in real-time before the next event.\n## Keywords"}

Most of the museum's halls are underground and have been designed to resemble an archaeological site.\nMain Entrance to the museum\n### A local favorite\nThe Aomori Museum of Art has, since 2006, lived up to its promise of introducing local Aomori art to the world. Its most iconic symbol is an 8.5-meter tall statue of the Aomori Dog by Aomori-born artist Yoshimoto Nara, whose works have been displayed worldwide.\nThe permanent collection includes works by local Aomori artists such as woodblock printmaker Shiko Munakata, photographer and playwright Shuji Terayama, and sculptor Toru Narita. There are also works by foreign painters including Henri Matisse, Rembrandt van Rijn, and Pablo Picasso.\nBefitting its status as a world-class contemporary art museum, the Aomori Museum of Art also holds temporary exhibitions, as well as concerts, plays, and seminars.

The town is surrounded by mountains and sea, and offers seasonal treats such as spring cherry blossoms, summer fireworks, and winter snow. Check Kinosaki Onsen's official website “Visit Kinosaki” for more details.\n### Don't Miss\n- Visiting the seven public bathhouses\n- Strolling in a yukata\n- Making a side trip to Onsenji Temple and the nearby mountain\n## How to Get There\nKinosaki Onsen Station is the gateway to the town, connected by the San'in Main Line to Kyoto and Osaka.\nIt takes about 2.5 hours from Kyoto or Osaka to Kinosaki Onsen Station by direct express train.\n### A riverside town\nOn either side of the Otani River are numerous Japanese inns, or ryokan, most of which have their own onsen baths.\n©Toyooka City\nThe seven public baths dotted around the town are one of the unique characteristics of Kinosaki. Visitors to the area can buy a one-day pass for 1,300 yen (as of November 2021) that allows bathing in all seven. Additionally, hot bubbling foot baths can be found in numerous locations. If you are staying at one of the town's ryokan, all of the public onsen can be accessed for free from when you check in until you check out.\n©Toyooka City\n### Slip on a yukata and stroll about town\nIt is not uncommon to see visitors to the area walking around the town in yukata—the thin cotton kimono that are closely associated with Japanese onsen towns. During the colder winter months, a warm, cotton haori jacket is worn on top of the yukata to keep out the cold.\n### The town's mysterious origins\nTowards the western end of Kinosaki Onsen is Onsenji Temple, which is dedicated to the Buddhist priest who supposedly founded Kinosaki Onsen in the 8th century. Legend has it that a priest named Douchi Shonin arrived in Kinosaki in the year 717, where he saw people suffering from incurable diseases. When he prayed for help, a white-haired man appeared to him in a dream, and suggested that he could find a hot spring. The priest believed the oracle, and chanted sutras for 1,000 days, after which hot water gushed from the ground, leading to the creation of the hot spring town.\n©Toyooka City\nOnce upon a time, visitors had to pray at the temple before they were allowed to enter the baths. While this is no longer the custom, the temple is still a great place to visit and can be combined with an enjoyable stroll through the mountains at Kinosaki's western edge.\nThe main hall of the temple can either be accessed by a short walk up the mountain or by taking the ropeway, which can take you to an observation deck at the top of the mountain.\n©Toyooka City\n### The Oriental White Stork Sanctuary\nDue to loss of habitat, the Oriental stork became extinct in Japan in 1971. The last bird actually died in Kinosaki Onsen's Toyooka City. Konotori no Sato Park was built as a research institute to protect and breed the storks, which are a National Natural Monument, and to reintroduce them to the wild. At the adjacent Stork Culture Museum, visitors can learn about efforts to reintroduce the storks, and see those used for breeding up close. The park is about 10 kilometers south of Kinosaki Onsen, and can be reached via bus from Toyooka Station.\n### Winter snow\nThe area around Kinosaki Onsen is great for activities and includes the Kannabe Kogen area. Here, visitors can enjoy climbing and hiking in summer or skiing, snowboarding and snowshoeing during winter. The town of Kinosaki receives regular snowfall and is very pretty during this season, as the river area is lined with fresh snow.\n## Keywords"}

An approximately 40-minute train ride on the Senseki Line gets you to Matsushima. Note: Get off at Matsushimakaigan Station (served by the Senseki Line), not Matsushima Station (served by the Tohoku Main Line), since the latter is far from the tourist attractions.\n### Take in the view\nTake a walk to Matsushima's coastline and enjoy the scene at your own pace. For a loftier view of the landscape and the 260 islands in the bay, look out over the landscape from higher ground.\nOther fine sights include the three islands with bridges that offer unique views, and the four recommended viewing spots—Ogitani, Tomiyama, Otakamori, and Tamonzan—collectively known as Matsushima Shidaikan. They take some time to reach but live up to their reputations.\nHop on a sightseeing cruise to enjoy the most popular close-up view of the islands. One course will take you on a loop of the bay, while the other runs one-way from Matsushima to the city of Shiogama. The sightseeing cruises run year-round. A bilingual audio announcement and maps detail the history and names of some of the more unusual islands.\n### Three footbridges to three islands\nThree of Matsushima's islands are connected to the mainland by footbridges, and easy to explore.\nThe central island adjacent to the ferry terminal is home to the small Godaido Temple, which has become a symbol of Matsushima. It is believed that a temple called Bishamondo was built on the island in the early 9th century. The current structure was built in 1604 by Date Masamune, the first lord of Sendai. The ornately carved hall is the oldest existing example of Momoyama architecture (1573–1615), in the Tohoku region.\nFukuura Island is easily spotted thanks to its 252-meter-long red bridge. For a small entrance fee, you can cross and wander around the forested island. Follow the paths to the opposite side for another splendid view of the bay.\nThe other island you can walk to is Oshima Island. Exit Matsushima-Kaigan Station, head for the shore and then go south along the coast for five to ten minutes. The temples and hand-carved meditation caves used by ancient monks are perfect places to contemplate life.\n### Two temples of note\nZuiganji Temple is the most important Zen temple in the Tohoku region. The temple was originally founded by the monk Jikaku Daishi (Ennin) as Enpukuji Temple, a Tendai sect temple, in 828. It prospered during the Kamakura period (1185-1333) as a Zen temple patroned by Hojo Tokiyori (the fifth ruler of the Kamakura shogunate), but later fell into disrepair. In 1609, Date Masamune, the lord of the Sendai domain, rebuilt the temple as Zuiganji Temple over the course of five years to serve as the Date family's temple.\nNext to Zuiganji Temple is Entsuin Temple, which was built by the Date clan leader Date Tadamune in 1646. The temple was constructed to mourn his son Mitsumune, who died at the young age of 19. The mausoleum holds a statue of the son on a white horse surrounded by Western motifs. Entsuin Temple has both a Japanese-style garden and Western-style rose garden. The autumn leaves here are particularly beautiful.\n### Feast on the bounty of the bay\nMatsushima offers plenty of freshly caught, succulent seafood at its many restaurants and food stalls at Matsushima Fish Market. Locals highly recommend the oysters, including oyster burgers, and anago (saltwater eels) and grilled squid.\n### Sample green tea on a veranda overlooking the sea\nFor a Japanese tea experience, visit Kanrantei. This teahouse was a gift from the ruler of Japan, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, to Sendai's daimyo Date Masamune. The Sendai feudal lord's son later moved it to Matsushima. Sip on bitter matcha green tea paired with a locally-produced Japanese sweet out on the engawa (an external corridor often used as a veranda), which offers a stunning view of the bay below.\n## Keywords"}

Enjoy strolling along the winding historic streets with the dozens of weeping cherry trees that line the roads in spring.\n### Visit the homes of the local samurai\nA number of homes and gardens, such as those of the Ishiguro and Aoyagi families, are open to tourists. Check out the old maps, books, pottery, tools, and swords on display at the Ichiguro Samurai House, which dates from the 19th century.\n### So much to see and do\nThere are also small museums, merchant storehouses, craft shops and cafes throughout the historic streets. Check out the Omura Art Museum, which has a beautiful collection of glassware. For those interested in traditional craftsmanship, Nishinomiya House showcases tansu chests, sake flasks, and lacquerware. Also in the area is the Shinchosha Memorial Literature Museum.\n### Pretty in pink\nThe banks of the Hinokinai River are planted with more than 400 cherry trees stretching as far as the eye can see. In spring they create a beautiful tunnel of fluffy pink blossoms.\nThroughout the year, the riverbank is a popular walking area, as people take in the lush leaves of summer, the vibrant and colorful foliage of autumn and snowy sights of winter.\n### Festivals aplenty\nExperience one of the many local festivals to soak up the town's culture. In summer, locals enjoy a traditional lion dance called Sasara-mai, which is accompanied by the performance of drums and a flute.\nIn autumn, kabuki-themed floats are wheeled through the streets.\nIn winter, the fire and snow festival sees bundles of rice straw set alight to ward off evil spirits and pray for health in the year ahead.\n## Keywords"}

This hiker's paradise covers more than 130,000 hectares with an equally impressive array of peaks, lakes, trails, gorges and valleys.\nPrime destinations for many travelers to the area include the Juniko lakes, Anmon Falls and Dairakyo Gorge. Any of these will thrill outdoor lovers, as will Aoike, a pond whose palette of blues changes with the weather and the season.\n### Don't Miss\n- The Mother Tree course—an easy trek to a 400-year-old beech tree\n- The Mt. Shirakami Trail and Juniko lake course—for hardcore hikers\n## How to Get There\nYou can get close to the Shirakami Sanchi area via train and bus, but renting a car after that is the best option.\nFrom Hirosaki Station in Aomori Prefecture, the Shirakami Sanchi Visitor Center is an hour away by the Konan bus bound for Tsugaru-Toge.\nYou can get to a few other specific destinations such as the Juniko lakes and Anmon Falls using public transportation. However, you may have to walk for a while from the nearest station.\n### Japan's outback, on the grandest scale imaginable\nThe Shirakami area extends as far as you can see, and all of it is pristine forest filled with beautiful lakes, clean trails, raised walkways and ponds. What you'll hear are birds, wild animals and the sound of water and wind.\n### A sea of beeches\nBeech trees are typically considered to have a lifespan of around 300 years, but in Shirakami Sanchi there are some believed to be more than 400 years old. Compared to ancient trees in other parts of the world, that may seem young. However, the size of these trees, with their thick green trunks and knotty limbs, is majestic.\n### Be sure to see at least one\nSome of the locations you should focus on in Shirakami Sanchi are the Juniko (\"Twelve Lakes\") and the three falls that comprise Anmon Falls. Juniko is the name given to a group of 33 lakes and marshes.\nThere's also a site called Nihon Canyon. The washed-out rock formations are captivating, and you can see them up close. You should also try to take one of the small networks of walking trails to scenic Dairakyo Gorge, especially if you're there in the fall.\nOther than a few mountain climber's paths, the parts of Shirakami Sanchi designated a World Natural Heritage Site are still mostly unexplored. The areas outside of this core are somewhat more accessible. But it is still mostly hiking trails. Put on your hiking shoes and explore.\n### For some background on what you'll see\nYou can learn about the Shirakami Sanchi area at the Shirakami Sanchi Visitor Center and also the Shirakami World Heritage Center.

There is nowhere more \"off-the-beaten-path\" than Shiretoko. It's a great place to connect with the simple pleasures of nature.\n### Don't Miss\n- Shiretoko National Park for Hokkaido nature at its best\n- Drift ice cruises in the winter\n- Delicious fresh seafood straight from the ocean\n- Watching rare birds\n## How to Get There\nThere are direct flights from Tokyo (both Haneda and Narita Airport) to Memanbetsu Airport and Kushiro Airport, and flights from Haneda Airport to Monbetsu Airport. For travel within Hokkaido, there are direct flights from Sapporo (New Chitose Airport) to Memanbetsu Airport and Nemuro Nakashibetsu Airport, the two closest to Shiretoko.\nLocal public transit is scarce, so it's best to see the area by car (or rental car). However, there is an overnight bus from Sapporo that takes you to the Shiretoko area's main bus terminals and hotels.\n### Pristine natural beauty at Shiretoko National Park\nShiretoko National Park is a UNESCO World Heritage Site set in the magnificent mountains and steep cliffs of the northern tip of the Shiretoko Peninsula.\nFrom spring to autumn, you can admire the serene five lakes known collectively as Shiretoko Goko, follow hiking trails to hidden waterfalls, or take a nature cruise from Utoro for the chance to see brown bears leading their cubs along the shore, as well as some of the many species of whales, dolphins, and seals that thrive in the nutrient-rich waters. In winter, take a cruise from Rausu to observe white-tailed sea eagles and Stellar's sea eagles. Or participate in a \"drift ice walk tour,\" where you wear a dry suit and walk on drift ice. The opportunity to dive under the ice floes is a unique winter experience in Shiretoko.\n### The tip of the iceberg\nThe Shiretoko area is much larger than just the national park and offers some wonderful surprises for the adventurous. Drive 50 kilometers south along the beautiful coast road from Rausu, and you will come to the entrance to Notsuke Peninsula, a long sandbar reaching out into the Nemuro Strait.\nTake a stroll to admire the dramatic landscape of sunken forests, grazing deer, wildfowl and native flowers. The imposing Kunashiri Island sits just a few miles across the waters.\nIn winter, you can see miles of drift ice floating south on the currents toward Nemuro and Cape Nosappu. Halfway between Notsuke and Nemuro is Lake Furenko, a mecca for birdwatchers. Roughly 300 species of wild birds are regular visitors here, so take all your camera gear to get some memorable snaps of Steller's sea eagles and Japanese red-crowned cranes.\n### Relaxing waters and mountain views\nHead inland and away from the choppy waters of the Nemuro Strait to get the best views of the glorious Shiretoko mountain range stretching out into the distance. Try Kaiyoudai Observatory in Nakashibetsu or Tawadaira Observatory in Shibecha for the best views.\nEnd your day with a hot soak and delicious dinner at secluded Yoroushi Onsen.\n### Rich and delicious fish\nIt's no wonder that so many bears, whales, dolphins, and birds thrive on and around the Shiretoko Peninsula. The waters are replenished annually by rich nutrients deposited by the drift ice, meaning you get to try some of the best local seafood in Japan.\nAs a starter, try some uni (sea urchin) and hokke (Atka mackerel) in Utoro and Rausu; follow up with some ikura (salmon roe), shrimp and scallop in Odaito; and there's always room for some Hanasaki crab from Nemuro and its famous sanma (Pacific saury).\n## Keywords"}

It can be reached by train plus free shuttle bus or by car.\nTake advantage of the free shuttle service from Sendai Station or Ogawara Station in southern Miyagi to reach the festival site in 40 to 50 minutes.\nIf you are driving, you must purchase a parking ticket in advance. Keep in mind that besides parking lot one, other areas are far from the venue and require waiting for the shuttle.\n### Origins dating back centuries\nThe festival started in 2001 with the goal of creating a fusion of history, culture and rock.\nThe name \"Arabaki\" refers to an ancient tribe in the Tohoku region. Under the leadership of warrior-general Aterui, that tribe fought against invading armies sent by the imperial Yamato court of central Japan. 1,200 years later this festival continues to honor the tribe's fighting spirit and passion for their home in a rock-inspired celebration.\n### When is the festival\nThe annual event is held over a weekend during the Golden Week holidays in Japan at the end of April or early May. Buy your tickets starting in early March. Check the official site for dates and more information.\n### Order your tickets early online\nPurchase your tickets online or at major convenience stores in Japan.\nIf you plan on staying at the campsite, be aware that each person needs to buy their own campground ticket and there are no tents provided. The campground is open with no reserved spots.\n### Who can I see perform?\nThe Arabaki Rock Fest performers change every year, so check the website for details. The line-up is dominated by famous and up-and-coming Japanese artists.\nPast performers include: Man With a Mission, the hard rock/dance-pop group known for wearing wolf masks during shows, Shishamo, the younger alternative/indie-rock band which made their debut after winning the grand prize in the Teens Rock in Hitachinaka music contest, and Yuji Ohno performing his jazz songs from the famous Lupin III anime.\nIf you need a break away from the main action, view the entertaining cultural performances. Keep an eye out for taiko drum performances, traditional dances, and the ever-popular Michinoku Pro Wrestling matches.\n## Keywords"}

Hundreds of trees on the Zao mountains are glazed with snow and ice, morphing them into strange monster looking figures.\n## How to Get There\nLocated in the mountains of Yamagata Prefecture, Zao Onsen Ski Resort is accessible by a 40-minute bus ride from Yamagata station.\nThe Yamagata Shinkansen Tsubasa departs from Tokyo and takes two and a half hours to get to Yamagata Station. By air, it takes only an hour from Tokyo Haneda Airport to Yamagata Airport. Then an hour by bus to the resort.\n### What are the \"snow monsters”?\nA combination of perfect winter weather and Zao's high altitude give birth to these monsters of the mountains. Cold air blowing from Siberia is trapped by the mountains running north to south through Tohoku. Water droplets in the air freeze onto the trees, creating towering monsters of snow and ice. While there are several places in the world to see this phenomenon, Zao is one of the largest.\n### Snow monster schedule\nThe season of snow monsters begins in December, and the monsters are at their biggest between mid-February and mid-March.\nThe monsters are on the upper slopes of the mountain. From Zao Sanroku Station use the Sanrokusen ropeway to access Juhyo Kogen Station and Jizo Sancho Station. Both skiers and non-skiers can view the monsters, though non-skiers are encouraged to hire a private guide.\nBoard the Nightcruiser snowmobile to see the monsters illuminated in mysterious colors during the evenings. Tours operate between late January to early March.\n### More than the monsters\nThe Zao Onsen Ski Resort and several natural hot springs can be found in the Zao Mountains.

Dozens of lifts, a few ropeways, and a gondola whisk you up to beginner, intermediate or advanced courses. Most courses are geared towards the adult leisure skier at the beginner to intermediate level. After a day on the slopes, relax in one of the town's many hot springs.\n### Spot the famous snow monsters\nDon't miss the famous snow monsters, found at the summits of the highest peaks. Thanks to a cold Siberian wind, ice freezes on the trees and snow accumulates to create unusual shapes that can only be found in a handful of places around the world.

In Japan, these two stars are called Orihime and Hikoboshi. According to legend, the lovers are separated by the Milky Way, and can only meet on one night a year. Tanabata festivals are usually held on the 7th day of the 7th month. Depending on the calendar used, that could mean July or August.\nJapan's biggest Tanabata festival is held in Sendai City from August 6-8. Sendai's shopping arcades are decorated with brightly colored handmade decorations and streamers, and people wear vivid yukata (summer kimono).\n### Don't Miss\n- The big streamers, which are several meters tall\n- The fireworks display on the night before the festival\n## How to Get There\nThe best ways to get to Sendai from Tokyo are via bullet train, air, or highway bus.\nBy train, take the Tohoku Shinkansen to Sendai Station from Tokyo, which arrives in around an hour and 30 minutes.\nVia highway bus, you'll find numerous buses throughout the day. These will take roughly six and a half hours depending on traffic.\nAir is the fastest option to reach Sendai in around one hour, but the most costly as well.\n©Sendai Tanabata Festival Support Association\n### Starting off with summer fireworks\nThe Sendai Tanabata Matsuri runs from August 6 to 8, one month later than most of the rest of Japan.

For example, a wastebasket represents cleanliness, while a net is displayed in hopes of a plentiful catch at sea.\n### The romantic story behind the festivities\nTanabata is a centuries-old tradition in Japan, born from a story about the doomed romance between the weaving princess Orihime (Vega) and the cow-herding Hikoboshi (Altair). When the lovers focused more on their relationship than their responsibilities, Hikoboshi's cows escaped wreaking havoc among the heavens.\nThe princess's strict father now only allows the couple to meet on the seventh day of the seventh month once a year if they work hard. That day is Tanabata.\n©Sendai Tanabata Festival Support Association\nThe latest information may differ, so please check the official website.\n## Keywords"}

For adventurous travelers, the island is a worthy day trip. You can explore the area on foot or by bicycle, or relax and do some fishing in the clear waters while enjoying spectacular views of Mt.

This festival is usually held in early August.\n### Don't Miss\n- The lanterns that are meant to ward off sleep\n- A performance on the giant taiko drums\n## How to Get There\nThe Hirosaki Neputa Matsuri takes place in the streets around Hirosaki Castle and can be accessed by train and bus.\nThe festival features three parade routes. One of the courses passes close to Hirosaki Station. The other two are accessible by bus. Many bus stops are close to one or more of the parade routes. Alternatively, you can walk from either Hirosaki Station or Hirosaki Castle to any of the locations.\n### Part of a pair\nIt's often said that the Hirosaki Neputa Festival is more elegant and low-key than the wild and frenetic Aomori Nebuta Festival. They are actually two sides of the same coin. Nebuta, in Aomori, celebrates the preparation for battle with its intense energy. Neputa, on the other hand, marks the victorious return of troops from combat.\n### The giant drums of Neputa\nThe giant taiko drums that are played in the Neputa Festival are probably its greatest highlight. The low, deep notes can be felt to your core.\nThree Odaiko are in the Hirosaki Neputa Matsuri, all of which have been given names. The Tsugaru Joppari Odaiko is 3.3 meters in diameter and weighs two tons. The other two odaikos are known as Tsugaru Go Joppari Odaiko and Dotten Daiko.\n### Drive away the sleep demon\nAnother legend about the Neputa Matsuri is that it is derived from an event held in mid-summer by farmers. During this time, when farm work is at its peak, the farmers get very little sleep. During the event, lanterns and lights were used to drive away the invisible demon that made the farmers drowsy. The modern Neputa Matsuri may have inherited the use of lanterns from this old farming tradition, but now they are used to celebrate.\nThe latest information may differ, so please check the official website\n## Keywords"}

A tactful farmer named Toukuro, who was in the vicinity, picked up his farming tools and began singing a rice-planting song, putting the situation to rest. This eventually led to the creation of the enburi dances.\n### Fast and slow\nThere are two types of enburi dances, Naga-enburi and Dosai-enburi. The Naga-enburi are slow and graceful, while the Dosai-enburi are lively and full of energy.\nBoth are performed by dancers wearing colorful costumes with the long, horse neck-shaped eboshi hat on top. The costumes and dances are a designated National Important Intangible Folk Property of Japan.\n### A fiery celebration every night\nThe festival closes each night with a bonfire, held in the public square in front of Hachinohe City Office.

Now a park has taken its place atop the hill that the Morioka clan chose as their base of power. The original buildings are gone, but the memory of the castle lives on in its stone walls.\n## How to Get There\nMorioka Castle is accessible by bus or taxi from JR Morioka Station.\nThe Morioka City Loop Bus stops at the Morioka Joato Koen (10 minutes from Morioka Station). Or you may decide to walk (15 to 20 minutes).\n### Quick Facts\nConstruction of the castle started in 1597 and was completed in 1633\nIn 1874, most of the buildings were demolished by the Meiji government\n### Emperors, shoguns, and warlords\nThe castle was built by the Morioka clan around a small hill where two rivers meet. As an important location for trade, the castle dominated the city for over 200 years. Unlike other castles in the Tohoku region that have earthen walls, Morioka Castle's stone walls were built from granite mined from the area around the castle.\nToday, the stone walls and a storehouse are all that remains of Morioka Castle. After the Boshin War ended in 1871, the Meiji government consolidated its power by abolishing domains and removing castles in lands that had opposed the government. Morioka Domain became Iwate Prefecture. Although Morioka Castle was allowed to remain, it was demolished due to neglect in 1874.\n### Death and rebirth of a castle park\nAfter the Meiji government tore down the castle and its surrounding buildings, the land sat idle for thirty years, until park designer Yasuhei Nagaoka turned the grounds into what is now Iwate Park.\nFrom 1906, Iwate Park has been open to the public. Since then, the grounds surrounding Morioka Castle have become a popular site for cherry blossom viewing, seeing the fall leaves, and poets. Two poets in particular, Takuboku Ishikawa and Kenji Miyazawa, loved the castle ruins and wrote many works about them. Today you can see monuments to both poets on the castle grounds.\n## Keywords"}

They were defeated, and the castle was destroyed.\nThe well-tended park that was built around the rebuilt castle is now a popular spot for seasonal activities such as cherry blossom viewing and candle festivals.\n### Quick Facts\nTsurugajo Castle was built in the 15th century\nThe annual Candle Festival celebrates Aizu's painted candles\nThe troops of the Byakkotai were all teenagers\n## How to Get There\nFrom Aizuwakamatsu Station, take the Aizu Wakamatsu Town Bus to the Tsurugajo Kitaguchi bus stop. The castle grounds are a five-minute walk away.\n### The castle and its museum\nCross the moat and enter the grounds past the impressive original outer walls. At the center of the park is Tsurugajo Castle, which was built in the 15th century and was besieged during the Boshin War of 1868.\nDemolished in 1874, the castle tower was rebuilt in 1965 in concrete, and has a museum dedicated to the history and culture of Aizu.\n### Flowers, signature candles, and illumination\nThe park is a popular place to view cherry blossoms. Get a blanket, pick a spot, bring drinks and food, and join the locals in partying and enjoying the beautiful blooms. During the fall season, the castle grounds are lit up at night to accentuate the autumn leaves.\nAizu painted candles, or erosoku, are one of the traditional crafts of Fukushima. Hand-made and beautifully decorated with plant and flower designs, they are the main feature of the Aizu Candle Festival held in February at the park.\nWhen you visit, be sure to view the scene from the top of the castle, since the candles are arranged in designs meant to be seen from above.\n### Enjoy tea on the castle grounds\nThe Rinkaku Teahouse was used for tea ceremonies by the lords of Aizu, and remarkably escaped the castle's destruction. Designated as an Important Cultural Property, it was restored and moved to its original location within the park grounds in 1990. You can visit the small garden attached to the teahouse, and drink tea in a small building overlooking the garden.\n### Resistance and a fateful sacrifice\nEven after the feudal period ended, the domains to the north of Tokyo held out against the new Imperial government. The Imperial troops were more modernized than the samurai armies and took one stronghold after the next. Aizu fell in September 1868, and the castle was severely damaged.\nA group of teenage samurai in a unit called the Byakkotai committed ritual suicide. Their loyalty and devotion made them famous in Japan and the subject of many films and manga. Their graves can be seen on Mt. Iimori.\n## Keywords"}

The pair visited Iyo-no-Kuni, which is now known as Ehime Prefecture. While visiting the area, Sukunabikona fainted from illness. To cure him, Okuninushi piped water from Beppu Onsen to the ancient Dogo Onsen, which miraculously cured Sukunabikona.\n### The bath of samurai\nLater, in the Kamakura Period (1185-1333), wounded samurai bathed in Beppu Onsen to help speed recovery.

The sweeping grasslands of the area are scattered with white limestone mounds and conical sinkholes. The Karst extends along rolling mountains and has multiple trails with expansive panoramas of the Shikoku region and the Pacific Ocean.\n### Don't Miss\n- The mossy trails and ancient trees of Keyakidaira\n- Other-worldly stargazing opportunities\n- Scenic hikes and stunning seasonal blooms\n## How to Get There\nHard to reach by public transport and therefore suited to intrepid travelers, this pristine natural hideout can be accessed by car from Kochi and Matsuyama or a combination of taxi, bus and train travel from Kochi Station.\nIf you choose to rent a car, the scenic drive from either Kochi or Matsuyama takes around two hours. The journey by public transport and taxi requires a number of changes.\nTo get there via public transport, depart from Kochi Station and arrive at Susaki Station to catch a bus towards Yusuhara. Change again at Shinden and take a taxi to Hoshifuru Village Tengu (formerly Tenguso), in the middle of the Karst. During the winter months, some areas of the Karst become inaccessible due to snow.\n### Quick Facts\nThe area is split into three parts; the Tengu Highland, Keyakidaira and Mezurudaira\nThe karst has an elevation of 1,400 meters\nThe area straddles both Ehime and Kochi prefectures\n### A place for all seasons\nThe Shikoku Karst transitions seamlessly with the seasons. Spring sees the grasses turn a vibrant hue of green. On hikes through the area in summer, you can see lilies all around. Old man of the mountain and forget-me-nots also dot the hillsides.\nRich, vibrant leaves cover the trees during fall months, whilst the grass turns a striking shade of silver. Then in the winter, you may find a dusting of the purest white snow covering the hillsides.\n### Forest bathing\nThe hiking trail in the Tengu Highlands that passes through Tengu Forest is a great way to soak up the area's incredible beauty. Look out for the Japanese cypress wood-chip paths meandering through the forest, which are surrounded by stunning white birch and red pine trees.\nThe walk takes approximately three hours and at the end of it, you are rewarded with fantastic views of the Shikoku mountains and on a clear day, the Pacific Ocean.\n### The great outdoors\nDuring summer months, camping is the perfect way to immerse yourself in the tranquil atmosphere of the Karst. The Mezurudaira area has plenty of campsites where you'll find pastoral scenes of cows lazily grazing. The Karst is so far from any major cities there is little to no light pollution, making it the perfect spot to stargaze.\n### A riot of color\nThe nearby Ogawamine area includes several notable mountains. Kasatori, Ogawamine, Mikawamine, and Ubahodo all reach heights of between 900 and 1,500 meters. In spring, the mountains are carpeted with the bold magenta rhododendron flowers. On a clear day, you can see Mt. Ishizuchi and the Sata Peninsula nearby.\n### Warm hospitality\nIn the midst of the Karst's Highlands sits the Hoshifuru Village Tengu (formerly Tenguso) and Mezuruso Cottages. Taste the flavors of the mountains, such as pheasant and wild boar served alongside the best of seasonal produce.\nHoshifuru Village Tengu has a large bath which looks over the Pacific and the Ishizuchi mountains, and is the perfect place to unwind after a long day of hiking. At Mezuruso, try amago, a red spotted masu trout from the nearby rivers of Kumakogen, cooked on an outdoor charcoal fire. Both accommodations also have campsites.\n### Starlight, waterfalls and fairytale villages\nMuch like Shirakawa-go, the thatched farmhouse village of Kumakogen Furusato Ryoko Mura could have been lifted from a fairytale. The planetarium and observatory offer unimpeded views of the twinkling night skies. Nearby, Omogo Gorge and Goraiko and Gongen waterfalls draw visitors with their clear rippling waters and dense surrounding forest.\n## Keywords"}

Winding through the mountains of Honshu's Kii Peninsula, an area straddling Wakayama, Nara, Osaka and Mie prefectures, it's been walked by pilgrims on their quest for enlightenment for over a millennium.\nModern travelers come to experience moments of quiet contemplation, commune with nature, and go deep into Japan's spiritual history.\n### Don't Miss\n- Treading the same paths as past pilgrims, including ascetics, samurai, emperors, and monks\n- Kumano Nachi-taisha Shrine and its temple, a perfect example of Shinto-Buddhist fusion\n- Taking advantage of the luggage shuttle services along the route so you can trek baggage free\n## How to Get There\nThe pilgrimage trails crisscross the Kii Peninsula, and access depends on your ultimate destination and how far you wish to hike. The main means of transportation to the area are Osaka, Kyoto, and Nagoya using the Kisei Mainline (also known as the Kinokuni line).\nTo access Kumano Nachi Taisha Shrine and Nachi Seigantoji Temple, take a 30-minute bus from Kii-Katsuura Station (on the JR Kinokuni Line) to the parking lot in front of the shrine and temple.\nAccess Kumano Hayatama Taisha via a 15-minute walk from JR Shingu Station, also on the JR Kinokuni Line.\nKumano Hongu Taisha is approximately an hour and 15 minutes from Kii-Tanabe Station (on the JR Kinokuni Line) via Ryujin Bus on the Kumano Hongu Line. Get off at Kumano Hongu Taisha-mae.\n### Quick Facts\nThe entire pilgrimage route is made up of seven trails\nIn 2004 the traditional trails along with their holy mountains were designated a UNESCO World Heritage site\nA mythical three-legged crow is the symbol of the Kumano Kodo, and of Japan's national soccer team\n### Kumano, the dwelling place of the gods\nSince its earliest days, the Kumano region has been regarded as a spiritually powerful area where gods inhabit the very fabric of the natural landscape.\nDuring the Heian Period (794-1185), former emperors began making the arduous trek to the region in search of spiritual enlightenment. The pilgrimage gradually became more widely known from that time.\n### The spiritual triumvirate of Kumano Sanzan\nKumano Sanzan is the collective name for the area's three most sacred shrines: Kumano Hayatama Taisha Shrine, Kumano Nachi Taisha Shrine (including adjoining Nachi Seigantoji Temple) and Kumano Hongu Taisha Shrine.\nTogether they are the sacred center of the Kumano region. Uniquely designed and originally offering separate forms of nature worship, the three eventually merged, becoming a major pilgrimage destination.\n### 99 Oji Shrines as spiritual signposts\nWhile the Kumano Sanzan shrines remain the big draw of the pilgrimage, many smaller shrines are scattered along the route. Known as the 99 Oji Shrines, their purpose is to provide protection and guidance for the wandering pilgrims.\n### Religious harmony through Shinbutsu-shugo\nBefore political policy forced them apart in the late 19th century, Buddhism and Shinto coexisted quite peacefully as Shinbutsu-shugo, a fusion of the two belief systems. Shinto gods were considered to be indigenous manifestations of Buddhist deities. This was the norm in Japan for over a thousand years.\nIn the 19th century, Buddhism was separated from Shinto and many temples and Buddhist statues were destroyed.\nWhile it's relatively rare to find Buddhist and Shinto elements intertwined today, Kumano Nachi Taisha Shrine and the adjoining Nachi Seigantoji Temple illustrate the traditional relationship very well.\n## Keywords"}
