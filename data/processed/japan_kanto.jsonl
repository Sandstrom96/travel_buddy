Stretching 66 kilometers along Chiba’s coast is Kujukuri Beach, Japan's longest stretch of sandy coastline, ideal for watersports. Deeper inland are a number of spacious parks and towering Mt. Nokogiri, with its \" Hell Peek Point.\" Chiba also has Japan's main international airport, Narita, making it the country's first entry point for most travelers.\n## How to Get There\nChiba is easily accessible via the JR Keiyo Line from Tokyo Station. You can also reach Chiba using the JR Sobu Line from various stations in the capital. Narita International Airport, Japan’s main international airport, is located in the prefecture.\nThe JR Sobu Line travels through several of Tokyo’s main stations, including Shinjuku, Tokyo and Akihabara. From Chiba Station, you can access many prefectural sights via the local train network. The Keiyo Line, which stretches around the bay, connects Tokyo to Chiba’s main urban attractions such as the Disney resorts and the Makuhari Messe exhibition center. You can use the Japan Rail Pass for JR train lines.\n### Don’t Miss\n- Tokyo Disneyland and DisneySea, the latter of which is unique to Japan\n- Swimming, windsurfing, diving and more at Chiba's beaches\n- Traveling back in time at the historic town of Sawara\n- Soaking up the beauty of Shinshoji Temple in Narita, listed in the Michelin Green Guide Japan\n## Explore Chiba by Area\n- \\\\\nChiba Bay Area\n- \\\\\nNarita and surrounds\n- \\\\\nKujukuri & Choshi\n- \\\\\nKisarazu & Around\n- \\\\\nBoso Peninsula\n## Trending Attractions in Chiba\n- Shinsho-ji TempleShinsho-ji Temple\\\\\nNaritasan Shinsho-ji Temple\n- Narita International Airport\\\\\nNarita International Airport\n- Yoro-keikoku Valley\\\\\nYoro Valley\n- Mt Nokogiri\\\\\nMt.

The stylish Boshu uchiwa, made from bamboo, is covered with handmade washi paper, silk or cotton to produce its iconic paddle-like shape. Chiba is one of three areas including Kyoto and Kagawa that are famous for their fans.\n- Namero\nNamero is a traditional fisherman's dish from the coastal area of southern Chiba. It is a mix of Pacific saury, jack mackerel and various other freshly caught fish minced together with leeks, ginger and miso. It can be eaten on its own or as an accompaniment to a bowl of freshly boiled white rice. It was originally prepared on boats in rough seas and uses miso instead of easily spillable soy sauce as seasoning.\n- Peanuts\nMost of Japan's peanuts are grown in Chiba, and they're famous for their rich flavor and slight sweetness. Chiba peanut farmers have found some unique ways to prepare the humble peanut, including baking, steaming, boiling and even pickling them.\n## Seasonal Highlights\n- Spring\nVisit one of Chiba's many parks to see flowers ranging from cherry blossoms and peonies to azaleas. April's Narita Drum Festival, one of Japan's leading taiko drum events, is a calendar highlight.\n- Summer\nPopular getaways for Tokyoites, surf, sun and lazy days await at Kujukuri, Onjuku and Okinoshima beaches. Fireworks festivals abound.\n- Autumn\nFall highlights include autumn-leaf viewing at Yoro Valley, or seeing mountainous colors from above, riding the ropeway up Mt. Nokogiri.\n- Winter\nWinter in Chiba sees plenty of holiday celebrations and from the contemporary at Disneyland, to more traditional offerings at Shinshoji Temple. Tokyo German Village is particularly popular for its illuminations."}

To access either, take the Keiyo Line from Tokyo Station to Soga Station. The trip takes one to two hours depending on how far you travel.\nBus: There are highway buses from Tokyo Station to specific Boso destinations like Tateyama and Kamogawa.\nCar: Take the Aqua Line from Tokyo to the Boso Peninsula.\nFerry: Take the Tokyo Bay Ferry to Kanaya on the Boso Peninsula from Kurihama on the Miura Peninsula. It takes about 40 minutes.\nKamogawa Seaworld's sea lion show\n### Learn about sea life at Kamogawa Seaworld\nOne of Chiba's most popular attractions is Kamogawa Seaworld, an aquarium on the southeast edge of the peninsula with a gorgeous view of the Pacific Ocean. It has around 11,000 sea animals including killer whales, dolphins, sea lions, belugas, pelicans, and penguins.\nThe aquarium is also a marine research and protection facility that promotes animal breeding. Regular performances and educational activities are held here, and you can interact with the animals.\nThe orca show at Seaworld\n### Tateyama Castle\nOne of the most historically significant structures in Chiba is Tateyama Castle. It was built in the latter half of the 16th century by feudal lord Satomi Yoshiyasu and rebuilt in the 1980s as an annex to Tateyama City Museum.\nThe castle sits on the 66-meter high hilltop of Shiroyama Park and is open to the public. Go inside to view exhibits on Chiba's history. The third-floor observation area offers sweeping views of Tokyo Bay.\n### Step back in time\nThe museum's exhibitions show you what life was like in the 16th century Boso. Permanent exhibits include displays of swords, armor, earthenware, and reconstructed houses, as well as information on Boso culture and folklore.\nShiroyama Park, which surrounds the castle and museum, is a lush area with beautiful cherry blossoms in the spring and is excellent for bird watching year-round. Rare plants and small shrines can be found throughout the park.\n### Views of the Pacific at Nojimazaki Lighthouse\nAt the very tip of the Boso Peninsula is Nojimazaki Lighthouse, one of the world's 100 most important lighthouses according to the International Association of Lighthouse Authorities. First lit in 1869, it was built under the Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Amity and Commerce at the beginning of the Meiji Period and was Japan's second Western-style lighthouse.\nThe 29-meter lighthouse has undergone some damage and reconstruction but maintains its basic original structure. It offers a panoramic view of the boats coming in and out of Tokyo Bay as well as the vast expanse of the Pacific Ocean.\n### Sandy beaches and coral on Okinoshima\nOkinoshima is at the southern end of Tateyama Bay. One kilometer in circumference, it is connected to the mainland by a hundred meters of sandy beach.\nThe water here is calm and clear and has the northernmost reach of coral in Japan. As such, it's a great place for snorkeling. The island contains various trees and plant life, unique seashells, and interesting rock formations. The sandbar that connects the island is a perfect place to watch the sunset.\n### Drive the Boso Flower Line\nThe Boso Peninsula is known for its many colorful flowers, and the Boso Flower Line is the perfect place to view them. This is a scenic road that stretches along the southern coast from Chikura to Tateyama. At the sides of the road are farms and parks with blooming flowers in all seasons, but the most spectacular are winter's nanohana (rapeseed) and swamp chrysanthemum. Along the way are quaint little seaside towns.\nAs there is a lot to see and do on the peninsula, be sure to set aside an entire day for your trip or consider an overnight visit."}

It offers many of the classic rides and areas found in Florida and California, with a few extras.\n### Unique DisneySea\nDisneySea is a sea-themed park that opened in 2001.

The park also has a barbecue area, meeting rooms, hostel-style accommodations and a camping area.\n### The vivid beauty of Chiba Shrine\nChiba Shrine is a large complex in the center of downtown Chiba. Its impressive vermillion structures and elegant gardens offer a contrast to the surrounding urban environment.

At the center is Izumi Bridge, a 65-meter suspension bridge across the pond.

The lighthouse is 140 years old, going back to the early days of Japan's modernization during the 19th century.\n### A modern viewpoint\nChoshi Port Tower overlooks the bay from the city of Choshi. Made of steel and reflective glass, the observation deck looks straight down into the fishing harbor at the mouth of the Tone River. You can try the local catch at the seafood restaurant on the ground floor.\n### See the curve of the earth\nMt. Atago is also known as “the hill where you can see the curve of the Earth,” and it lives up to its name. At over 400 meters in height, it's Chiba Prefecture's highest point.\n### Perfect sunsets\nAn observatory at the top offers a 360-degree panorama of the ocean, the surrounding countryside, and the curved arc of the horizon. It's also an excellent spot for watching sunsets. On a clear day, you can see as far as Mt. Tsukuba, Cape Inubo, and Kujukuri Beach.\n### Mobara Park's stunning blossoms\nMobara Park is an extensive park in the city of Mobara, built around a huge pond stocked with colorful carp and traversed by red lacquer bridges. The park is especially gorgeous in spring when almost 3,000 cherry trees burst into flower.\n### Historical train rides\nTrain enthusiasts will enjoy riding the vintage cars of the Choshi Electric Railway between Choshi and Tokawa. Even the train tickets sold on the line are old-fashioned, thick cardboard. The quaint stations along the route feature European architecture; the whole line has the atmosphere of a charming animation. In fact, the Choshi Line and its stations have been immortalized in novels and TV dramas."}

Fuji, its hazy outline dominates the landscape in many parts of the eastern Kanto Region. But unlike Mt. Fuji, which is desolate and rugged, Mt. Tsukuba's slopes are covered with vegetation and blooming flowers.\n### An easy hike Mt. Tsukuba\nAlso unlike Mt. Fuji, it is a relatively low mountain, and the hike is generally quick and easy.

Yokohama's shopping malls and shiny towers make the night view of its skyline one of the most beautiful in Japan, and its past as a trading port gives it an international flair. Further down the coast of Kanagawa, Kamakura is packed with temples, quaint restaurants, and cafes, and the onsen town of Hakone is the place to relax in hot springs and view Mt. Fuji.\n## How to Get There\nKanagawa is accessible via regular trains from Tokyo and via the JR Tokaido Shinkansen from Kyoto, Osaka and Nagoya, as well as highway bus and car.\nKawasaki is 20 minutes along the JR Tokaido Line from Tokyo. For Hakone, get off at Odawara on the JR Tokaido Shinkansen line. From there, take the Hakone Tozan Railway to the final stop. For Yokohama, get off at JR Shin-Yokohama station if you are taking the shinkansen from Kyoto or Nagoya. If you’re coming from Tokyo then the regular trains are easier and cheaper, just 30 minutes on the JR Yokosuka Line and other local train lines. Kamakura is another 30 minutes south.

Atsugi is famous for its horumon, carefully prepared using fresh pork from within the prefecture.\n- Yokohama Scarves\nSilk was exported in large quantities from Yokohama after the opening of its port 150 years ago, and Japan's silk industry supported the country's modernization, and also its restoration after WWII. After the war, printing techniques advanced and silk scarves printed with colorful designs became popular. In the 1970s Yokohama scarves accounted for approximately half of the printed silk scarves manufactured around the world. The Japanese printing technique rivalled those of Como, Italy, and still to this day, Yokohama scarves charm people around the world.

Eaten boiled, dry, or raw with soy sauce, they add a fresh ocean flavor to many dishes across the region.\n- Hakone Wood Mosaic\nThis is a very exquisite woodcraft technique with geometric patterns, born in the late Edo period. It fuses traditional woodworking techniques from the Heian period (794-1185) and the rich colors of the tree species native to Hakone. It is the only Traditional Handicraft of the Odawara/Hakone region, and it was awarded national status in 1984. (Photo: 小田原箱根伝統寄木協同組合)\n- Kamakura Carved Lacquerware\nThe art form derives from carved lacquer (carved vessels made from layers of lacquer), which was introduced from China some 800 years ago. It developed as court carpenters and Buddhist priests moved into the production of lacquerware. A characteristic feature of Kamakura carved Lacquerware are the delicate chisel marks that can made out around the edges of the carved details.\n- Yokosuka Sukajan Jackets\nCreated in the late 1940s in Yokosuka City, Kanagawa Prefecture, these colorful, hand-embroidered satin jackets became massively popular in Japan, especially with the U.S. military. The embroidery is the same used for kimono. In recent years they have been gaining popularity overseas. In addition to being introduced at Paris Fashion Week in 2016, the jackets received a lot of attention as officially licensed products for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.\n## Seasonal Highlights\n- Spring\nWhen the cherry blossoms appear and the festival season starts, the temples of Kamakura and the parks of Yokohama are the places to be.\n- Summer\nThere are Blue Flag-certified beaches in the prefecture, including the popular Enoshima Island, which attracts visitors to enjoy marine sports. Hakone is also popular as a summer resort.\n- Autumn\nKamakura's temples are framed by Japanese maples—momiji—and the autumn leaves in Hakone are simply beautiful.\n- Winter\nOnsen waters warm the body and heart, and views of snow-capped Mt.

It is famous both inside and outside of Japan as a resort area brimming with natural hot springs of the highest quality, and for its stunning views of Mt Fuji.\n### Don't Miss\n- Soaking in some of the country's finest hot springs\n- The boat tours around Lake Ashinoko\n- The life-prolonging black eggs at Owakudani\n- Outdoor art installations at the first open-air museum in Japan\n## How to Get There\nThe gateway to Hakone, Hakone-Yumoto Station, is located in western Kanagawa Prefecture, and is easily accessible from Tokyo.\nYou can take the Odakyu Line from Shinjuku Station to Hakone-Yumoto Station (about 90 minutes).\nOr take the JR Tokaido Shinkansen from Tokyo Station to Odawara Station, and then take the Hakone Tozan Railway from Odawara Station to Hakone-Yumoto Station (about 55 minutes).\n### Quick Facts\nThere are 17 types of hot springs in Hakone\nThe area is located at the base of the Mt. Hakone volcano\nLake Ashinoko formed as a result of Mt. Hakone's last volcanic eruption 3,000 years ago\n### Hot springs in operation for hundreds of years\nHakone is made up of seven hot spring resorts, one of which is Miyanoshita, which began operating in the Edo period (1603-1867). Miyanoshita's Fujiya Hotel opened in 1878 to attract foreign visitors, thus increasing the popularity of the area. Many well-known celebrities, including John Lennon, have stayed at this hotel over the years. Like Hakone's other hot spring towns, the retro atmosphere of the town works in its favor.\n### Take a dip at a hot spring theme park\nAnother popular destination in Hakone is Hakone Kowakien Yunessun, a kind of hot spring theme park. Here, you can bathe in a host of hot spring baths-some somewhat unusual such as the coffee, red wine and green tea tubs. There are both swimsuit-friendly and non-clothed areas, making it great if you aren't quite ready to bare everything.\n### Pirate ships and lofty heights\nThe most iconic view in the area is arguably that of Mt Fuji from the southeastern shore of Lake Ashinoko. Take one of the sightseeing boat tours to explore and enjoy views from the lake. The pirate ship-shaped boats operated by Hakone Sightseeing Boats add a little extra fun to the experience.\nLake Ashinoko in winter\nAlternatively, ride the Hakone Tozan Railway through the area. Trains pass through dense forests and across bridges high up over picturesque gorges.\n### Visit a volcanic valley\nBudget some time to visit Owakidani, a volcanic valley with active hot springs and sulfur vents. The scenery is surreal with volcanic gas and steam billowing up from all around.\nIf you can stomach the strong smell of sulfur and feel like a snack, you may want to try one of the black eggs sold in the valley. They are boiled and blackened by a chemical reaction in the hot springs. Eating one is said to prolong your life by seven years.\n### Japan's first open-air museum\nJust a short walk from Chokoku-no-Mori Station is the Hakone Open-Air Museum.

Initially housed in a huge wooden hall, it was restored in the Edo period (1603-1868) after being damaged over the years by typhoons and earthquakes. Today it is the most popular site in Kamakura as well as the second largest seated Buddha in the country.\n©Kamakura City Tourist Association\n### Tsurugaoka Hachimangu Shrine\nTsurugaoka Hachimangu is the heart of Kamakura and the spot around which the city developed.

The Kamakura Annex is located near Tsurugaoka Hachiman Shrine, while the Hayama Annex requires a short bus ride to the south. Four or five exhibitions are held annually, so check the website for the exhibition schedule before visiting.\n### Kamakura Festival and Tsurugaoka Hachimangu Reitaisai Festival\nKamakura Festival and Tsurugaoka Hachimangu Reitaisai Festival\nBoth festivals center around the Tsurugaoka Hachimangu Shrine.

In summer the area overflows with visitors looking to enjoy the sea, sun, surfing, and fresh seafood. There are restaurants and cafes on the beach during the Summer months.\nThis area is often compared to the beaches of Southern California for its lifestyle, especially the surfing community that developed and flourished during the '50s, '60s, and through the '70s, along with popular music.\nA visit to the Kamakura area can easily fill up a whole day with the amount of sights to see. Overnight stays are strongly recommended."}

The rocky coastline with views of Mt. Fuji has inspired artists for centuries.\n### Don't Miss\n- The Miura Kaigan area, with spectacular views of the bay\n- Jogashima, a rugged coastal island\n## How to Get There\nFrom Tokyo and Yokohama, the peninsula can be accessed by train, but for further exploration, you'll need other modes of transport to get around.\nThere are two gateways to the peninsula. On the eastern side is Yokosuka, about 40 minutes from Yokohama on the JR or Keihin Kyuko Lines. On the western side is Zushi, served by the JR Line to Zushi Station. You can reach Zushi in 30 minutes from Yokohama.\nTrains run down the middle of the peninsula to Kurihama and Misakiguchi, but bus or other transportation is required if you want to get around. It's a popular area for cyclists, and the route is the perfect distance for a day-trip.\n### Life's a beach\nThe western coast from Zushi to Hayama is host to a number of beaches with fantastic views of the sea, Mt. Fuji and the Izu Peninsula in the distance.\nIn July and August, the beaches are full of temporary beach stalls offering food, drink, and entertainment.\n### Seafood paradise\nSmall fishing villages populate the peninsula, and that means fish markets. Some of the best are at Sajima and Nagai, but the biggest is down the coast at Misaki, home of tuna boats that ply the seas for the highly prized fish.\n### Farm life\nYou'll have a wide choice of dining choices, with a large number of tuna restaurants and shops. The peninsula is also famous for its farm produce, and tourist buses come from Tokyo and elsewhere to shop for vegetable bargains at Sukanagosso, a busy farmers' market. Miura daikon, a large radish, is the area's best-known product.\n### Rock climbing and tide-pools\nThe island of Jogashima, jutting out from the end of the peninsula is accessible from Misaki. It's a wild and windswept place of rugged beauty, and the rocky coast is an explorer's paradise. You can catch a harbor taxi from the Misaki fish market across to the island as well.\n### Ferry across to Kurihama\nHeading north up the peninsula from Jogashima, you'll come across Kurihama, where you can catch a ferry across the bay to the even larger peninsula of Chiba, or visit Perry Park, with its mementos of when the U.S. Commodore Matthew C. Perry first landed in Japan on June 9, 1853."}

With its many sights, traditional shops, and popular seasonal events, the area truly comes alive on the weekend, making it a great day trip from the heart of Tokyo.\n### Don't Miss\n- Kawagoe's Warehouse District, the Toki no Kane bell tower, and traditional candy shops\n- Taisho-Roman Street's elegant and nostalgic buildings from the Taisho (1912-1926) and Showa (1926-1989) eras\n- Kawagoe's many intriguing temples and shrines\n## How to Get There\nKawagoe is located in southwestern Saitama, north of Tokyo, and is less than an hour from major Tokyo stations by express train.\nYou can access Kawagoe's main station, Hon-Kawagoe, by taking the Seibu Shinjuku Line express train from Seibu Shinjuku Station. Seibu Shinjuku Station is a 5-minute walk north of JR Shinjuku Station. It takes under an hour to get to Hon-Kawagoe from Shinjuku.\n### Walk down the streets of merchants\nKawagoe is called Koedo, which means \"Little Edo\" in Japanese. Its streets have been maintained since Japan's historic Edo period (1603-1867). The Warehouse District on Kurazukuri Street is lined with old earthen storehouses, unique two-story buildings from the time the city flourished as a major transportation and commerce hub.\nA sight not to be missed is the Toki no Kane, or \"Bell of Time.\" This bell tower has marked the time for centuries, and continues to ring four times daily.\n### Wander the delightful candy alley\nKawagoe has many other things to see, including Candy Street, a street lined with stores where traditional Japanese candies are made the old-fashioned way.\n### The many faces of Buddha\nThere are several beautiful temples and shrines in Kawagoe worth visiting, most notably Kitain Temple. It was built about 1,200 years ago. The most striking aspect of the temple is its 538 stone statues of Buddha, each with its own face and unique posture. No two statues look exactly alike, and according to popular belief, there is a statue that resembles anyone who visits the temple.\n### Mythical and playful sacred sites\nKawagoe Hikawa-jinja Shrine is a Shinto shrine dating back to the 6th century that has a torii gate 15 meters tall.\nKawagoe Kumano-jinja Shrine is a place with fortunes and points of interest on its grounds that are fun for both children and adults. The shrine is within walking distance from Hon-Kawagoe Station.\n### Nostalgic Taisho-Roman Street\nKawagoe also introduces visitors to the relatively recent history of Japan as well. Taisho-Roman Street is lined with old, retro western-style buildings from the Taisho and Showa eras. Luckily there are also no overhead power lines, which makes it great for photographs and film shoots. This street has been used for shooting many of the Japanese period films set in these eras.\n### Kawagoe Castle\nKawagoe Castle's Honmaru Goten is the only remaining building of Kawagoe Castle. It was the castle's innermost palace and served as the lord's residence and offices. It played an important role in the early Edo period as a satellite fortress for the ruling Tokugawa Shogunate. Enter the building to get a sense of what the life of a feudal lord was like back then.\n### Kawagoe's festival floats\nIf you would like to experience the town's major festival, the Kawagoe Festival, visit during the third weekend in October. This exciting event sees ornate floats gather in the heart of the town, and features a musical competition in the evening."}

The name comes from the tradition of shopkeepers handing out fans (uchiwa) to passersby to beat the summer heat that the area's so famous for.\nThe festival features a colorful parade of floats, mikoshi portable shrines, music, special events, and food and drink. The main event of the festival is its drumming competition, where young men perform on the festival's parade floats and try to out-drum each other. The floats depict legendary Japanese historical features such as Jimmu, its first emperor.\n### Enjoy the scenery from the historic paleo express\nKumagaya Station is the departure and arrival station for the Paleo Express, an old steam locomotive that travels through some of the prettiest mountain scenery in the Kanto region. The train runs alongside the Arakawa River. On either side, you can see forested mountain slopes and views of the river. Not only is the scenery pretty, but it's a rare chance to ride an historic steam train."}

Fitting the Japanese aesthetic of wabi-sabi simplicity, its popularity began in the 19th century because it was attractive yet practical. The pottery was mostly used as kitchenware at the time.\nToday, the allure of Mashiko's pottery attracts buyers from around the globe, and pieces are shown in art collections, including the Ceramic Art Messe Mashiko.\nA reconstruction of Shoji Hamada's kiln\n### Not a mess: Ceramic Art Messe Mashiko\nIn modern Japanese, the German word \"messe,\" meaning a \"trade fair,\" has also come to be used for certain kinds of theme parks.\nCeramic Art Messe Mashiko houses a variety of earthenware-related facilities, with the Mashiko Museum of Ceramic Art as its centerpiece.\nInitially, the museum focused exclusively on Mashiko-yaki. Recently, it has also begun displaying modern ceramic work from overseas.\n### The kiln of a master craftsman\nFamed artisan Shoji Hamada established a studio in Mashiko in the early 1900s after discovering how wonderful its soil was for pottery. His house, workshop, and kilns, which were built based on ancient designs, have been relocated to Ceramic Art Messe Mashiko.\nHamada's work was at the center of the Japanese art world's Mingei movement.

Its most famous shrines and temples, among the most magnificent in Japan, are a UNESCO World Heritage site. The surrounding national park is a destination for hikers of all levels.\n### Don't Miss\n- Taking in Nikko's World Heritage architecture\n- Crossing into the Futarasan-jinja Shrine grounds at Shinkyo Bridge\n- Hiking Nikko's sacred surroundings\n## How to Get There\nTobu-Nikko Station is easily accessible from Tokyo's Asakusa and Shinjuku stations in about two hours.\nTravelers can reach Nikko from Gunma Prefecture, with buses running from Oze between mid-spring and mid-autumn.\n### World Heritage Nikko\nThe World Heritage site Shrines and Temples of Nikko consists of 103 structures spread over three complexes. They are all within easy walking distance of each other, making for an unforgettable day absorbing some of Japan's most gilded religious architecture.\nOne of the most impressive and rightfully most visited is the Toshogu Shrine complex. Toshogu is the mausoleum of Tokugawa Ieyasu, the founder of the powerful Tokugawa Shogunate which ruled Japan from 1603 to 1867. Lavish, colorful, and intricately carved, Toshogu Shrine stands in stark contrast to many of Japan's more stoic religious structures.\nTake plenty of time to absorb the detail of its five-storied pagoda, colorful storehouses, and dazzling, flamboyantly carved Yomeimon Gate. Walk up to the Toshogu graveyard for a beautiful view over the Toshogu complex. Do not miss the Toshogu Treasure Museum on the approach to Toshogu, with an animation depicting the life of Tokugawa Ieyasu.\n### Nature worship and Buddhism\nEighth-century Futarasan-jinja Shrine is dedicated to the worship of Nikko's three sacred mountains. You can wander the impressive main grounds for free, and check out the inner garden with its ancient trees for a small fee. Futarasan-jinja Shrine has a branch at nearby Lake Chuzenji, and hardy hikers can visit a third branch on the summit of Mt. Nantai in the warmer seasons.\nRinnoji Temple, also founded in the 8th-century, houses three regal Buddha images said to represent Nikko's three sacred mountains. They are a perfect example of the era when elements of Buddhism and Shintoism were strongly intertwined. Its garden is a popular spot for viewing colorful leaves in the autumn.\nWhile it is not part of the World Heritage complex, Taiyuinbyo Temple is another Nikko must-see. Brilliantly decorated, it features a mix of Shinto and Buddhist elements. It is the mausoleum of Tokugawa Ieyasu's grandson, the Shogun Tokugawa Iemitsu. In 1636, he transformed the smaller original Toshogu Shrine into the brilliant World Heritage masterpiece awaiting visitors today.\n### Nikko's traditional river crossing\nShinkyo Bridge is a part of the World Heritage Futarasan-jinja Shrine. Legend has it that when the first priest attempted to ascend sacred Mt. Nantai, the Daiya river stood in his path. He prayed for a safe crossing, and the river god spawned giant snakes that formed the bridge. For much of its existence, only Futarasan-jinja Shrine parishioners and the imperial court could make the crossing. Now, it's commonly regarded as the gateway to the major Nikko shrines and temples.\n### Hiking in Nikko\nNikko National Park is home to an ancient tradition of mountain worship. The three sacred peaks of Mt. Nantai, Mt. Nyoho, and Mt. Taro, known collectively as Nikko Sanzan, dominate the area, and you can get in touch with the area's mystical side by trekking these mountains.\nTowering over Lake Chuzenji, 2,486-meter Mt. Nantai is one of Nikko's highest, as well as most sacred, and frequently climbed peak. The steep trail to the top starts from Futarasan-jinja Shrine at the foot of the mountain. It serves as a branch of the World Heritage shrine of the same name. Climbers going to the summit are asked to pay a small fee. When you arrive at the top, soak up the view over Lake Chuzenji, and congratulate yourself on reaching the Okusha, Futarasan-jinja Shrine's most outlying structure.\nWhichever trek you choose, bring your boots, provisions, and a sense of adventure; hikes to the summits and back involve a full day on the trail and are for those with at least moderate physical fitness.\nYou'll find easier hiking around Lake Chuzenji. There are rewarding hikes all around Nikko that cater to every skill and fitness level, so check with the Nikko Tourist Information Center for a hike perfectly suited to you.\n### More around Nikko\nDon't miss the Tamozawa Imperial villa, part of which dates back to 1632.\nLake Chuzenji and its onsen area are easily accessible by bus from the city. The must-see Kegon Falls is widely considered one of Japan's most spectacular cascades.\nIn late March and early April, a 16-kilometer corridor of cherry trees blooms between Utsunomiya and Nikko on the old Nikko Kaido Route. A bus ride between the cities will let you take it in on the go; rent a car to stop off for photos as you please.\nWhile in town, don't miss eating yuba, a Nikko specialty. Yuba is a soy product that has featured in Buddhist cuisine for centuries. Locals put it in almost everything, including ramen, sushi, rice cookies, and Nikko's famed yuba manju sweets."}

The remains of the underground quarry cover an area of about 20,000 square metres and are 60 metres deep at their deepest point, creating a huge underground space reminiscent of an underground temple.\nThe main hall of Oya-ji Temple is set into a naturally eroded cave. The walls of the cave are carved with statues of Buddha, including as the thousand-armed Kannon and three statues of Shakyamuni (the historical Buddha), which are designated as National Important Cultural Properties and Special Historic Sites.\nWakayama Farm has about 24 hectares of fields with bamboo forests as far as the eye can see. Visitors can enjoy picking bamboo shoots, chestnuts and other harvesting experiences. Popular activities include walking through the bamboo grove with the soothing sound of rustling bamboo leaves, enjoying a cup of green tea served in a bamboo bowl, and walking through the illuminated bamboo grove at night."}

The fabric appears to be a solid color from a distance but up close a delicate pattern is revealed through repeated dots and tiny lines. Once worn by high-ranking samurai, komon is now prized for its beauty and the skills required in its production.\n- Tokyo Dyed Silk\nElegance and sophistication define the subtle designs of Tokyo Yuzen kimonos, still produced in the city today. This technique of dyeing and hand-painting silk dates back over 300 years, and is unique in that the entire process from design to completion is handled by a solitary artist, allowing for wonderful individuality.\n- Fukagawa-Meshi\nFukagawa-meshi combines clams, miso and leeks to make a warming, flavorful soup that is poured over a bowl of rice. Clams and leeks are first boiled together to create a rich, briny broth, before miso is then added. The resulting soup and clams are then poured over a bowl of white rice. Fukagawa-meshi is typically eaten with chopsticks so don't be afraid to pick up the bowl and slurp. Outside of the Fukagawa district of Tokyo, this dish can be hard to find.\n- Murayama Oshima Pongee Silk\nPrized for making beautiful, natural, lightweight kimonos, Musashi-Murayama Tsumugi is a blend of silk and cotton dyed in a unique process known as itajime, where the threads are bound to a wooden board and splashed with color. The result is a distinctive blurred effect in blues and browns.\n- Tokyo Shamo\nA breed of chicken imported to Japan from Thailand as gamecocks. As a delicacy, Tokyo shamo yield an oil-rich cut of chicken that is perfect for grilling yakitori style.\n- Monjayaki\nA savory pancake made of finely chopped cabbage, flour, egg and dashi. Other ingredients such as pork, shrimp and octopus are added according to your tastes. Monjayaki has more dashi in its batter than its Kansai cousin, okonomiyaki, giving it a melted cheese texture.\n- Edomae Sushi\nThe style of sushi most familiar worldwide. As Edo, which is now Tokyo, became wealthier, sushi became a less formal, faster style of dining. Busy Tokyoites simply sat down at the counter and called out their orders to the nearest itamae—the chefs.\n- Japanese Swords\nJapanese swords are revered for the strength and beauty of their blades as well as the “spirit of the samurai” history they represent. Regarded as works of art more than as weapons, superb examples of these swords can be viewed at the Japanese Sword Museum in Sumida, Tokyo.\n- Edo Cut Glass\nOriginally made in Edo—present-day Tokyo—kiriko is decorated entirely with precision cuts. Exquisite patterns characterize these statement pieces, making this cut glassware a perfect addition to any bar set.\n## Seasonal Highlights\n- Spring\nSee the city take on a gentler appearance as the plum blossoms and cherry blossoms flower.

The story goes that all the way back in 628, two fisherman brothers pulled a statue of Kannon, the Buddhist goddess of mercy, from the Sumidagawa River. Although they tried to return it to the river, it always came back to them. They built Sensoji to house this sacred statue and to honor Kannon, completing it in 645.\nFor centuries, a constant flow of visitors has come to pay their respects and pray in the temple's main hall. Around the central building, you can also see the Goju-no-To five-tiered pagoda, several smaller halls, and charming little gardens, one of which houses Tokyo's oldest stone bridge and wooden structure. To the right of the main hall, you will find Asakusa Shrine, where the three men who founded Sensoji are enshrined.\n### Traditional shopping streets and snacks\nAfter passing through Kaminarimon, explore the bustling Nakamise Street where traditional crafts, printed cotton kimono, and the wafting scent of Japanese sweets will compete for your attention. Try the famous old-school snacks dorayaki, fried manju buns, or mochi skewers.\nBranching out, you will find dozens of smaller shopping streets, perfect for a leisurely wander. Denpoin-dori, Kannon-dori, and Asakusa Chuo-dori are particularly attractive, and still maintain the flair of the Asakusa of yore as people are carted around on rickshaws past bright-red lanterns and bridges.\nFor those looking for more modern shopping opportunities, the nearby Rokku district is home to several department stores, discount shops, and entertainment venues, including the (in)famous cabaret club Rockza which launched comedian Beat Takeshi's career.\n### 21st century attractions beyond the temples\nVisible from within the Sensoji temple grounds is Asakusa's newest attraction, the soaring Tokyo Skytree. Rising 634 meters, this futuristic tower offers panoramic views of the city—and on clear days all the way to Mt. Fuji. While an impressive sight all year round, during the spring visitors gather in Sumida Park to capture photos of the tower surrounded by cherry blossoms.\n### Party like a samurai\nEveryone loves a good festival and the residents of Asakusa are no exception. Throughout the year, the neighborhood hosts several exciting events. The Sanja Matsuri Festival in late May sees the streets filled with the cries of teams heaving heavy portable mikoshi shrines, and the Sumida River fireworks display is a highlight of the summer. Sensoji also has yearly markets, including the Hozuki-ichi (ground cherry market) in July, Tori-no-ichi in November and Hagoita-ichi in December.\n### Asakusa after dark\nMost visitors to Tokyo seeking a fun night out head towards Shibuya or Roppongi, but Asakusa is where locals have been coming for decades, even centuries, to relax after the sun goes down. Lit up until 11 p.m. most nights, Sensoji offers an entirely different atmosphere after sundown, so check it out before going in search of delicious local food and famous old-school drinks.\nJust west of Sensoji is Hoppy Street, so named for the drink made with this non-alcoholic beer and shochu, sake's stronger cousin. Aside from the fizzy beverage, Hoppy Street also has a number of casual open-air eateries where you can get fresh-grilled yakitori skewers or the area's specialty: beef stew. You also won't want to miss stopping by Kamiya, Japan's oldest Western-style bar, famous for its original brandy-based cocktail Denki-Bran."}

Both offer domestic and international flights at all hours of the day; however, Haneda is much closer to downtown Tokyo and Yokohama.\nWith a central location, quick transportation, and short-term accommodation options, Haneda is a great entry point to the country and for exploring further.\n### Don't Miss\n- Visiting Ota Market for fresh produce\n- The Tokyo Monorail for a unique ride into town\n- Staying in an airplane-themed capsule hotel\n## How to Get There\nHaneda Airport is easily accessible via train or monorail from downtown Tokyo.\nFrom Shinjuku or Shibuya station catch the JR Yamanote to Hamamatsucho Station, then transfer to the Tokyo Monorail to Haneda Airport. Alternatively, take the Keikyu Airport Line from Shinagawa. There are also a number of limousine buses to Haneda Airport that depart Tokyo Station every 30 to 60 minutes. The limousine buses also leave from some of the major hotels.\n### A history of Haneda\nIn the years before the COVID-19 pandemic, the airport served over 60 million passengers per year, making it the country's busiest airport and one of the busiest airports in the world. Haneda opened in 1931 and was Tokyo and Yokohama's major airport for both international and domestic flights.\nIn 1978, Narita Airport opened and took charge of the majority of Tokyo's international air traffic, while Haneda continued to connect a majority of the nation's domestic travelers. Following its new runway completion and new international terminal building in 2010, Haneda began to service more international routes.\n### Stay at the airport\nAs Haneda Airport's international terminal is open 24 hours, the surrounding area offers a number of flexible accommodations for those with late or early flights. Each of the airport's three terminals also has its own hotel on site.\nFor those wanting to stay in the terminal area, The Royal Park Hotel Tokyo Haneda is located at Terminal 3, the Haneda Excel Hotel Tokyu is located in Terminal 2, and the First Cabin Tokyo Haneda, an airplane-themed capsule hotel, is located in Terminal 1. There are other hotels nearby, most served by free shuttle buses.\n### Riding the monorail\nInitially built for the 1964 Olympics, the Tokyo Monorail is a pretty unique way to get to and around the Haneda Airport area. Stopping at each of the three terminals, the monorail offers views of Tokyo Bay on its way to Hamamatsucho Station, which takes about 15 minutes. From Hamamatsucho Station, you can catch the Yamanote Line, Tokyo's main loop line.\n### Ota Market\nIf you have some time to kill before or between flights, consider visiting Ota Market, an excellent way to discover some of the best local produce from the city and its surrounding area.\nLocated just one stop from the airport on the Tokyo Monorail Haneda Express train, Ota Market is one of Japan's biggest markets. At over 380,000 square meters, it's larger than Tsukiji's fish market (which has since moved to a new location) and boasts a huge selection of vegetables, fruit, and fish.\n### In the airport\nHaneda offers many things to do inside the airport terminals themselves. From the observation decks, you can see planes taking off and landing with Tokyo in the background, while enjoying a glass of Haneda's very own craft beer, Haneda Sky Ale. Visit the past as you stroll the Edo Koji shopping area, or do some pop-culture shopping in Tokyo Pop Town."}

However, their aesthetics couldn't be more different.\n### Don't Miss\n- Harajuku's extravagant streetside sweets, such as cheesecake-filled crepes and unique themed cafes\n- Espace Louis Vuitton, a gallery hidden on the top floor of the Louis Vuitton Building\n- An unparalleled luxury shopping experience in Omotesando Hills\n## How to Get There\nHarajuku and Omotesando are both easily accessible by train.\nTake the JR Yamanote Line to Harajuku Station for Harajuku's Takeshita Street or the Metro Chiyoda Line to Meiji Jingumae for Omotesando. Both areas are connected by a main boulevard, so the best way to travel around is by foot.\nQuick Facts\nTakeshita Street in Harajuku is the center of Tokyo's street fashion scene\nOmotesando is the approach to the Meiji Shrine, opened in 1920\nThe bridge by Harajuku Station is a popular spot for cosplayers and rockabilly dancers\n### Opposites Attract\nWhile Harajuku is often at the forefront of the next big local trend, Omotesando focuses on the international and timeless. While Omotesando is all about luxury brands, the streets of Harajuku are overflowing with thrift store jackets and novel accessories.\nThough their attitudes can contrast at times, these two Tokyo hotspots share a unique sense of cultural harmony and mutual appreciation that you won't find anywhere else. If Harajuku is the cool teenager, then Omotesando is the more mature and sophisticated older sibling.\n### Tokyo's street fashion mecca\nFor cheap, fun trends, make your way to Takeshita Street in Harajuku. Here you'll find upcoming trendsetting boutiques sharing walls with more iconic long-term staples like the nearby Dog, known to be frequented by fashion icons like Lady Gaga. Keep an eye out for deals as you dig through the shelves, and don't forget Daiso and Thank You Mart, Takeshita's two big discount stores.\nWeave your way through the back streets that shoot off Takeshita to uncover a variety of tiny shops and at the end cross the main road to find Harajuku's sneaker district (look for the small alleyway to the right of Murasaki Sports). For the ultimate in \"kawaii\" fashion, be sure to stop by 6% Dokidoki, located near Meiji Jingumae station behind the Kawaii Monster Cafe.\n### Designer labels and cat streets\nOver the past few years, Omotesando has become Japan's home of modern high-end fashion, with many designer labels setting up stores along the lavish and spacious boulevards that line the area. The second biggest upscale shopping neighborhood after Ginza, Omotesando differs from Ginza by focusing on more contemporary names like Maison Margiela, H&M, and MVRDV over classics like Dior and Prada (although both have locations in the area). Head to the iconic Omotesando Hills mall for seven floors of high-end fashion.\nPhysically and aesthetically between Harajuku and Omotesando lies Cat Street. A little more upmarket than Takeshita Street's offerings and less expensive than Omotesando, this popular local shopping destination is filled with some of the best variety of stores and cafes in Tokyo.\n### Where the future and past collide\nIn addition to high-end upscale shopping and cutting-edge trends, the corners of these two neighborhoods are filled with a rich history. Harajuku is home to Meiji-jingu Shrine, one of the city's most famous and well-trodden spiritual sites, and one of the area's largest green spaces. Originally completed in 1920, the shrine was destroyed during the Second World War, but was rebuilt not long after.\nOmotesando is the front approach leading to Meiji-jingu, with the Japanese \"omote\" meaning \"front\" and \"sando\" meaning \"approach.\"\n### Galleries galore\nIf there's one thing that connects the Omotesando and Harajuku areas, it's a love of art. Both neighborhoods are filled with mainstream and independent galleries displaying works from both local and international artists.\nBe sure to visit Design Festa Gallery in Harajuku and Espace Louis Vuitton in Omotesando to get a broad overview of what the area has to offer, or hit the backstreets for the cozy Nezu Museum."}

For scenery, shopping, hairstyling, dining, cafes, and art, this area is defined by its cool and sophisticated atmosphere.\n### Don't Miss\n- Exploring the area's shop-filled side streets\n- Wandering riverside during cherry blossom season\n- Embracing hipster life by dining at Nakameguro Koukashita and browsing books at Nakameguro Tsutaya Books\n- Indulging in a specialty blend at Starbucks Reserve Roastery Tokyo\n## How to Get There\nNakameguro is a quick 5-minute journey from Shibuya by train.\nTake the Tokyu-Toyoko Line, just two stops from Shibuya on the train bound for Motomachi-Chukagai. Nakameguro Station is also a stop on the Tokyo Metro Hibiya subway line.\nYou can also catch a bus from Shibuya. From Nakameguro Station, the gorgeous path along the Meguro River is just across the street.\n## What to do in Nakameguro\n### Stroll along the riverside\nThe best place to experience Nakameguro is along the banks of the Meguro River. More aptly described as a canal, the waterway lends the area a European feel. Dotted with traditional shop fronts and izakaya, the suburb, however, remains distinctly Japanese. You'll find boutique shops, cafes, and fantastic dining options along both sides of the waterway. Many of the riverside cafes offer terrific views of the promenade outside–it's great for people watching.\n### Experience the famous Nakameguro Cherry Blossom Festival\nThe charm of the river walk is amplified tenfold in spring when the cherry trees bloom. Nearly every tree along the riverside explodes with cherry blossoms, forming a tunnel of flowers over the river. The mood is definitely celebratory, but while the river is considered one of the best places in Tokyo for flower viewing, note it's also one of the most crowded.\nIn the evening Nakameguro kicks its spring celebration into high gear. Lanterns illuminate the trees, and the entire stretch of the river becomes lively with festival cheer. Grab some street food, a sudsy beer and mingle with fellow visitors at one of Tokyo's most famous sakura-viewing hotspots. If the crowds become too much, escape to one of the many side streets for an artisanal coffee or craft beer.\n### Shopping and sophistication\nHome to youthful celebrities, artists, and fashionistas, Nakameguro is renowned as one of Tokyo's most fashionable shopping and dining districts. Wandering its streets—main and arterial—will see you encounter stylish design and interior stores, edgy clothing retailers, independent galleries and atmospheric eateries. Along the riverside, you'll also find a charming lineup of cafés and boutique shops, known for their relaxed vibe and carefully curated offerings, perfect for a leisurely afternoon.\nThe gleaming interior of the Starbucks Reserve Roastery Tokyo ®\nOne standout spot in the neighborhood is Starbucks Reserve Roastery Tokyo®, which offers a one-of-a-kind coffee experience that sets it apart from any other branch of the iconic coffee chain. Set in a beautifully designed, wood-filled space by architect Kengo Kuma, the interior features unique, Nakameguro-inspired touches like a four-story tall cherry blossom–inspired copper cask. Visitors can enjoy exclusive Nakameguro-only blends and menu items in a sophisticated, modern atmosphere.\n### Reading under the railway\nNakameguro Koukashita is a vibrant mix of happening restaurants, cool cafes, and trendy stores underneath the local train tracks. Visit here, too, for Nakameguro Tsutaya Books, stockists of trendy texts, Japanese stationery and hosts of semi-regular pop-up exhibitions.\nFor more information:\nStarbucks Reserve Roastery Tokyo ®\nhttps://www.starbucks.co.jp/reserve/roastery/"}

You can also ride the Saikyo Line from major stations such as Ikebukuro, Shinjuku and Shibuya to Tokyo Teleport Station.\n### From capital defense to weekend leisure\nThe name Odaiba means fort, referring to the cannon batteries which were constructed to defend the city after the arrival of the American \"black ships\" in the 19th century. These batteries were eventually converted into parks and landfill, but in the 1990s the mayor of Tokyo decided to redevelop the Odaiba area as a spot for future innovation and modern living.\nNowadays, Odaiba is an up-and-coming area popular with young people and families on a budget looking for a holiday without leaving the city. In 2021, Odaiba hosted beach volleyball and triathlon swimming during the Olympics.\n### Rainbow Bridge\nConnecting the Odaiba waterfront to Shibaura Pier on the other side of Tokyo Bay, the 800-meter-long bridge is Odaiba's main symbol, and has brought life and development to the area since its completion in 1993.\nFrom the bridge, which takes around 30 minutes to cross on foot, you can get panoramic views of the Odaiba area. At night, it lights up with its namesake colors and is visible throughout Tokyo.\n### Some of Tokyo's best shopping all in one place\nAt the center of Odaiba is the sprawling Aqua City Odaiba shopping mall complex. The boutique building runs for 300 meters along the waterside and offers everything from high-end fashion to quirky bargain buys. A futuristic multiplex cinema is the hub of entertainment in the area, which also features a Legoland Discovery Center and a virtual Sega theme park, Joypolis.\nOn the other side of the Fuji TV building and its iconic suspended globe is DiverCity Tokyo Plaza, another large shopping mall best known as the location of the giant Gundam robot installation. The mall itself houses tons of Japanese and international brand stores, as well as a Round One entertainment and sports center.\n### Odaiba Kaihin Koen\nVisible from Rainbow Bridge, Odaiba Kaihin Koen is one of Tokyo's only open white-sand beach areas. While you are not permitted to swim in the water, other marine activities are available such as volleyball, paddle boarding, surfing, and windsurfing. Walk along the beach as you look at the Tokyo skyline and consider renting some gear. At one end of the park is an interesting, if somewhat perplexing, feature: a replica of the Statue of Liberty.\nThe Tokyo Water Bus stops here. It will take you back towards downtown Tokyo, and stops at Hamarikyu Gardens, Ryogoku Sumo Stadium, and Asakusa near Tokyo Skytree.\n### Top tourist spots\nOdaiba has an incredibly high concentration of fun attractions, and you could easily spend several full days exploring its many offerings. These include Sony Explora Science, Tokyo's Madame Tussauds Wax Museum, Shiokaze Park, the Miraikan (the Nation Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation), Trick Art Museum, Tokyo Sewerage Museum, Fuji TV Station, the Panasonic Center, the Big Sight Convention Center, and the School Ghost House.\nFor a great free event, check out the lantern festival in Odaiba Park held on Marine Day, on the third Monday in July."}

It's said that six very old and large zelkova trees were once used to mark the area. Another local legend is that the six lords who lived near the area during the Edo period each had the kanji character relating to trees in their name.\nThough the area was always quite heavily trafficked, it wasn't until after the Meiji Restoration in 1868 that it started booming. In 1890, the area saw an influx of Japanese soldiers, and later American soldiers, make their residence here, resulting in a burgeoning nightlife, something that Roppongi is still very well known for today.\nModern day Roppongi and Akasaka are a fascinating mix of overseas tourists, longtime expats, and Japanese residents, giving the neighborhood a sophisticated, international feel unlike anywhere else in Tokyo.\n## What to do in Roppongi\n### Tokyo's nightlife and urban culture capital\nRoppongi is arguably Tokyo's most popular nightlife district, particularly for overseas visitors.

The National Art Center, housed in a spectacular building across from Tokyo Midtown, typically hosts exhibitions based around a specific unifying theme, as well as an impressive selection of work by local artists.\nFinally, inside Tokyo Midtown itself is the Suntory Museum of Art, which gives you a look inside Japanese culture and history. Finding beauty in everyday life, this gallery space is filled with collections of incredible Japanese paintings, ceramic wares, and textiles.\nAside from the Art Triangle, the area is filled with smaller museums and gallery spaces like Ota Fine Arts, Zen Foto Gallery, 21\\_21 Design Sight, and complex665.

From Shibuya, the express Keio Inokashira train will take you to Shimokitazawa in less than five minutes.\n### Quick Facts\nOnce a farming town, Shimokitazawa is now home to Tokyo's indie film, music, and theater culture\nWith up to 2,500 people crossing every signal change, Shibuya Crossing is the busiest in the world\nShibuya's station front is home to a statue of Hachiko, Japan's most famous dog\n### Unlikely beginnings\nBoth the neighborhoods underwent significant changes to become the city hubs they are today. The laid-back corner of Shimokitazawa was once an agricultural town, which can still be seen in its narrow, pre-automobile streets.\nThanks to its close proximity to Shibuya and lower living costs, Shimokitazawa became popular with young families and students after the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923 and especially after World War II. Right after the war, it was home to a marketplace for American soldiers, creating a hotspot for young, Western culture.\nAs Shimokitazawa was going through a period of social and cultural evolution, Shibuya was doing the same. A Tokyo train stop since 1885, Shibuya became the main station for the Tokyu Toyoku line's route to Yokohama in 1927. Now the Den-en-toshi Line, this new connection established the area as one of the city's major transport and economic hubs. Today it's the second-busiest station in the world after Shinjuku.\n### Go digging in thrift store paradise\nIf Harajuku and Omotesando are the centers of fashion's cutting-edge future, then Shibuya and Shimokitazawa are home to its present and past. Shibuya's mega shopping centers like the iconic 109 and brand-new Hikarie stock everything being worn by the young and trendy, while also offering a number of well-curated secondhand shops and outlets. Look out for independently run stores like The Sun Goes Down to find well-priced one-off pieces.\nIf you have a love for retro, bargain hunting and antiques, Shimokitazawa has more thrift stores than you could see in a single day. Home to a number of chain outlets like Flamingo and Chicago, Shimokitazawa also has great deals at New York Joe Exchange or the 700-yen flat-priced Stick Out. You'll also find some of Tokyo's best curated Western vintage at Haight & Ashbury. The streets of Shimokitazawa are awash with independent, niche and very comprehensive secondhand fashion outlets. The hardest thing is knowing where to begin.\n### Music for every taste\nFor secondhand records, both neighborhoods rival one another in terms of selection and price. While Shimokitazawa has the smaller, more selective secondhand record outlets like Flash Disc Ranch and Disc Shop Zero, Shibuya has mega stores like Recofan and DiskUnion. Most stores cover a variety of genres and formats like CD, vinyl, DVD and cassette so if you're chasing that rare limited-run picture disc, you should spend some time hunting around these areas.\nFor the best in new music, Shibuya is also home to the Tower Records flagship store.\n### Experience the many sides of Tokyo nightlife\nFrom DJs to live bands, on any given night Shibuya and Shimokitazawa are putting on a music performance to suit your tastes and get you dancing.\nShimokitazawa, along with Koenji, is home to many live music venues. Small, more rock-focused dive bars with eclectic lineups, like Club 251, Garage, and Era, populate the area, but the main space is Shimokitazawa Three, which hosts shows by both new upcoming names and local legends.\nIf you're more into clubbing and electronic music, Shibuya is your destination. The main nightclub capital of Tokyo, Shibuya's venues, like Womb, Contact and Sound Museum Vision, see big-name acts and unique one-off parties all-year-round.\nBoth areas also have ample dining, bars, karaoke and theaters."}

From modern high rises to green oases, it's a mecca for shopping, eating and relaxing.\n### Don't Miss\n- Shinjuku Gyoen, an oasis of nature amid the crowds\n- Bustling nightlife and endless shopping opportunities\n- City Hall, high-rises, and futuristic neon cityscapes\n## How to Get There\nTwelve separate lines run through Shinjuku Station, including the JR Yamanote Line.\nShinjuku is at nine o'clock on the JR Yamanote Line, on the fashionable western side of the city (alongside Shibuya, Yoyogi, and Harajuku). Other lines, above and below ground, pass through Shinjuku. It is also a major stop for highway buses feeding into Tokyo from the rest of Japan.\n### Getting your bearings\nShinjuku Station is officially the busiest transport hub in the world. When it was registered by Guinness World Records in 2007, an average 3.64 million people used Shinjuku Station per day.\nWith so many platforms, it is labyrinthine. Never be so casual as to suggest meeting someone \"outside Shinjuku Station\": JR, Keio, Odakyu, Toei and Tokyo Metro all have stations within the Shinjuku Station complex, which also boasts underground malls, restaurants and cafes. Shinjuku is defined by its station.\n### More than a transport hub\nAs a result of all this human traffic, Shinjuku caters to all tastes and desires.\nMajor department stores including Isetan, Takashimaya, Keio, and Odakyu have flagship stores in Shinjuku. Kinokuniya Bookstore, Tokyu Hands, Bic Camera, Yodobashi and Labi all have a huge presence right in front of the station.\nThere are thousands of stores in the immediate vicinity, and if you stroll in any direction from the station, there are thousands more shops, restaurants, bars, clubs and movie theaters. Shinjuku has everything you want and much you didn't know you needed.\n### Pink lights, nightlife and 24-hour party people\nKabukicho is where the party happens. Often called the town that doesn't sleep, more accurately, it passes out for a couple of hours late morning.\nDespite its sometimes sleazy reputation, it is a must-see destination for young people and foreign visitors and is becoming more family-friendly. With over 4,000 bars, restaurants, clubs and convenience stores, there is a lot to choose from in such a small area. Oddities like the Robot Restaurant, a giant Godzilla, the Samurai Museum and Thermae-Yu baths have made it a popular attraction. Golden Gai, Hanazono Jinja, and even Koreatown keep people coming back for more.\n### Not all fun and games\nShinjuku is also home to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Office Building (Tocho), which dominates the skyline. Even among the rest of the towers of south Shinjuku, Tocho stands tall. The views from the free observation decks are stunning.\n### Fit for an emperor\nAmid the steel, concrete, and chaos, with millions of people shuffling through each day, Shinjuku Gyoen garden is almost a dreamlike aberration. It's a well-kept secret, and outside of cherry blossom season and the turning of the leaves in fall, it is a tranquil escape from the neon and noise.\nEmperor Showa (1901-1989), who was the last person in the imperial family to have experienced the garden as a \"personal\" garden, loved it so much that his funeral was held in a special ceremony here.\nThe many flowers, carefully manicured trees, the classic Japanese Garden and Taiwanese Pavilion, the verdant greenhouse, as well as the mix of French formal and British landscape styles, all are designed to convey joy and peace to stressed urbanites."}

Korakuen is home to Tokyo Dome, a multipurpose stadium that hosts baseball games as well as concerts. Next to it is an amusement park and shopping complex that offers entertainment for both children and adults. The University of Tokyo with its photogenic buildings and landscape is about a kilometer away.\nNot to be missed are the sightseeing spots around Iidabashi, including the stylish shopping and restaurant district of Kagurazaka and the historic garden of Koishikawa Korakuen.\n## How to Get There\nThe closest station to Tokyo Dome is Korakuen Station on the Tokyo Metro Namboku Line. Many of the sightseeing spots in the area are also reached from Iidabashi Station. The JR Chuo Line, Chuo-Sobu Line, Tokyo Metro Namboku Line, Yurakucho Line, Toei Oedo Line, and Tozai Line all stop at Iidabashi.\n### Things to do in the Tokyo Dome area\nThere's nothing quite like watching a baseball game live. Join other baseball fans and see the action first hand at Tokyo Dome, the home stadium of the Yomiuri Giants. With a seating capacity of 55,000, Tokyo Dome is also a coveted performing location for musicians.

{"filename": "www.japan.travel_en_destinations_kanto_tokyo_tokyo-islands_.md", "country": "japan", "region": "kanto", "url": "https://www.japan.travel/en/destinations/kanto/tokyo/tokyo-islands/", "title": "Tokyo Islands", "category": "destination", "text": "# TOKYOTokyo IslandsVolcanic islands each more beautiful than the next the farther south you go\n- Tokyo Islands\n## Volcanic islands each more beautiful than the next the farther south you go\nMost people think of Tokyo as a buzzing metropolis. The Tokyo Islands couldn't be more different than the city of the same name. This chain of volcanic islands includes the Izu Islands and the remote subtropical Ogasawara Islands, all technically part of the Tokyo area.\n### Don't Miss\n- Vacationing in the crater of a volcano on Aogashima\n- The Ogasawara Islands; Japan's version of the Galapagos Islands\n- Catching some surf on the island of Niijima\n- Swimming with wild dolphins off Miyake Island\n## How to Get There\nThe islands are all accessible by ferry with all but the most remote also served by airplane and helicopter.\nWith ferries to all islands, the Takeshiba Terminal in Tokyo is the best departure point for travel by sea. Ports in Yokohama and Shizuoka also operate select services for access from outside the capital.\nHigh-speed ferries operate from Tokyo to Oshima and other less remote islands in as little as two hours, making even day-trips possible. With the exception of the Haneda-Hachijojima route, all flights depart from Chofu Airport, on the outskirts of Tokyo. The furthest south you can fly by airplane is Hachijojima.\nNote that the ferry to the Ogasawara Islands takes 24 hours and operates only once a week.\n### Catch some waves in the clear blue water in the Izu Islands\nThe clear blue waters and rolling surf make Niijima a popular spot with surfers. After a bracing swim, hop into the seafront hot spring near the port to warm up.\nYou can also enjoy snorkeling or diving in the waters off Niijima. The warmer waters around the volcanic Tokyo Islands have created the perfect habitat for tropical fish and corals. Hachijojima is a particularly good spot for diving.\n### Something special to take home\nA popular souvenir from Niijima is green glass made from volcanic rock. Try your hand at making your own glass art to take home with you. On Oshima Island, pick up skin care products made with locally grown camellia oil. In late winter, you can see the stunning camellia flowers in bloom around Oshima Park.\n### Exotic flora and fauna in Ogasawara\nA UNESCO World Heritage site, the Ogasawara Islands are a haven for wild birds and other exotic species such as the bonin white-eye, found only on Hahajima. The unspoiled natural environment of the two islands (Hahajima and Chichijima) make them fascinating to visit, and the sheer variety of plant life is astonishing. Hiking trails offer an alternative to the beach, and are an excellent opportunity to get close to nature.\n### An epic sea journey\nPart of the magic of the Ogasawara Islands is the journey there. The only way to access the islands is by a single weekly ferry that takes 24 hours. The Ogasawara-maru runs from Takeshiba Terminal in Tokyo passing under the Rainbow Bridge, past Odaiba and out of Tokyo Bay with views of different islands en route.\nPlaying games, reading, chatting with other passengers or taking in the sights from the deck, the long journey affords you the rare experience of old-fashioned travel. Sleep overnight and when you wake up the next morning, you will be greeted with views of the islands and a hearty breakfast at the ferry's restaurant.\n### Islands shaped by volcanic forces\nThese islands are part of the Fuji Volcanic Belt, and evidence of their volcanic origins is all around. The most visible reminders of this heritage are the many hot spring baths dotting the islands.\nFor the ultimate volcano experience, choose Aogashima. The island is a volcanic crater that rises out of the sea. You can cook eggs, veggies, and other foods over volcanic steam vents or take a sauna in the geothermal-powered facility on the island.\n©Miyakejima Tourist Association\n### See whales and dolphins up-close\nDolphins and whales populate the waters around Chichijima and Hahajima islands. Book a boat tour to get a close-up view of these beautiful wild animals frolicking in their natural habitat.\nIf the Ogasawara Islands are too far, try Miyake Island. Unlike your average dolphin-watching tour, you can get in the water to swim with them in the wild.\n### Island-hop in style\nWith well-established ferry routes to and between the different islands (except for the Ogasawara Islands), the volcanic chain is ideal for island-hopping. However, to really travel in style and for the best views, especially over Aogashima, consider island hopping by helicopter. Toho Air Service operates a fixed flight schedule and rates are relatively inexpensive."}

Soaring skyscrapers overlook the quiet Imperial Gardens, and the station's striking 1900s-style facade conceals sleek bullet trains and a wealth of pop culture shopping and intriguing culinary options.\n### Don't Miss\n- The serene gardens, moats and traditional structures surrounding the Imperial Palace\n- Steaming bowls of noodles from stores across the city at stalls in Ramen Street\n- Museums and shops housed in retro buildings\n## How to Get There\nTokyo Station is a major hub for many commuter trains and Metro lines, as well as the bullet trains.\nBesides bullet trains from all over the country, Tokyo Station can be reached from within the city limits on the Yamanote Line, Chuo Line, Sobu Line and Keihin-Tohoku Line. For those using Tokyo Metro lines, the Marunouchi Line is convenient. Although it is a bit of a walk, you can also reach Tokyo Station via underground passageways linked to nearby Otemachi Station, where the Tozai, Chiyoda, Hanzomon and Mita metro lines stop.\nIf you are coming from Narita Airport, the Narita Express (NEX) connects to Tokyo Station and takes about an hour.\n### Visit the Emperor's domain\nBuilt upon the former site of Edo Castle—once the largest castle in the world—the Imperial Palace is usually only visible from afar.　However, you can sign up for a tour of the majestic inner grounds. Make sure to book in advance through the Imperial Household Agency's website.\nHead to the Imperial Palace's East Gardens to stroll through meticulously manicured Japanese-style gardens and see the ancient castle walls. The gardens are open to the public. Runners and cyclists circle the palace regularly; join them if you have the chance.\n### Cherry blossoms by the palace\nWhile a walk around the Imperial Palace grounds is lovely in all seasons, during cherry blossom season Chidorigafuchi Moat comes alive with delicate shades of pink and white. With a short walk from Kudanshita Station, you can stroll under a canopy of gently falling sakura blossoms or even rent a rowboat for a scenic float around the moat. Make sure to go early in the day to avoid the crowds.\nNearby, Yasukuni Shrine holds a yearly cherry blossom festival with food stalls and popular evening illuminations.\n### Shopping, art, and culture\nDon't be fooled by all the gleaming office buildings—the Marunouchi area is filled with museums, shops, and upscale restaurants. For high-class shopping with European flair, look no further than the tree-lined avenue of Naka-dori stretching between Tokyo Station and the palace.\nRight by the station, the Shin Marunouchi Building, KITTE, and Daimaru department stores are popular options for visitors searching for a perfect gift or the latest in Japanese fashion.\nPrefer to pursue art and learning? The red brick halls of the Mitsubishi Ichigokan Museum house a bijou collection of Japanese and Western art as well as a pleasant retro cafe where you can rest your feet. Other options for art include the nearby Museum of the Imperial Collections in the East Gardens, the National Museum of Modern Art, Tokyo and Science Museum in Kitanomaru Park, and Intermediatheque in the KITTE building.\n©Bank of Japan Currency Museum\n### Around Tokyo Station\nThanks to its central location, you can easily walk from this area to Ginza, an elegant shopping district, or Nihonbashi, home to the Coredo Muromachi shopping centers and traditional restaurants. For a quick bite to eat, Tokyo Station City—the underground shopping area beneath the station—is an excellent option with plenty of choices."}

Historically significant temples, museums of modern art and technology, and even some relaxing nature all await you.\n### Don't Miss\n- A chance to see Mt Fuji on a clear day\n- A cup of tea in an oasis of mid-metropolis green\n- One Piece Tower, an amusement park inside Tokyo Tower's base\n## How to Get There\nYou can access Tokyo Tower by subway and bus.\nTokyo Tower is five minutes on foot from the Toei Oedo Line's Akabanebashi Station, six minutes from the Toei Mita Line's Onarimon Station, and seven minutes from Kamiyacho Station on the Tokyo Metro Hibiya Line. Buses run through this area from many parts of the city.\n### Tokyo's steel giant\nTokyo Tower is visible from all around the city and is a true symbol of the capital. It was built in 1958 as Japan was becoming a major economic power. If you want a good view of the city, you can take in the breathtaking scope of the sprawling metropolis around you from the 250-meter high Top Deck or the main observatories slightly below. If you prefer to have your feet closer to the ground, explore the area until sunset and watch the tower light up in a dazzling display.\n©TOKYO TOWER\n### The enduring temple of the Tokugawas\nOn the sprawling grounds of Shiba Park below Tokyo Tower is Zojoji Temple. This now-quiet temple has extreme historical importance. Tokugawa Ieyasu designated it as the Tokugawa family temple and the burial ground for a number of the 15 Tokugawa shoguns. Most of the temple's original buildings were burnt down in World War II, but the imposing front gate has withstood centuries of natural and manmade attacks and is designated an Important Cultural Property. Give yourself ample time to wander the grounds, and be sure to stop by the treasure gallery and mausoleum of past Tokugawa shoguns, as well as the museum in the lower level of the main temple building. You'll see a model of one of the lost temples which is on loan from the British Royal Family. Exploring Shiba Park will reveal a number of small shrines, temples and other memorable wonders.\n### Museum hopping\nIf the touristy amusement park at the base of Tokyo Tower doesn't pique your interest, the area around Tokyo Tower offers many small museums providing insight into various worlds of Japanese history and business. The NHK Museum of Broadcasting takes you through the ages of radio and television, while the Ad Museum Tokyo in Shiodome highlights the history of Japanese advertising, and the Panasonic Living Showroom showcases all the necessities for modern urban living. Walking out toward Roppongi will bring you to a trio of museums featuring traditional and contemporary art: Kikuchi Kanjitsu, Sen-oku Hakukokan Tokyo (scheduled to reopen in spring 2022), and the Okura Museum of Art.\n### A moment of urban calm\nA walk through Shiba Park and toward Hamamatsucho Station will bring you to Hamarikyu Gardens, formally known as Hamarikyu Onshi Teien. These magnificently manicured Japanese gardens offer you some Edo era calm below the imposing skyscrapers of the nearby Shiodome district. Originally they were a strolling ground for the Imperial family until being opened to the public in 1946. Have a fragrant, relaxing cup of tea in the floating teahouse and take time to unwind among the striking seasonal blooms. From Hamarikyu Gardens, you can catch the \"water bus\" going up the Sumida River toward Asakusa for a unique way to tour the city."}

While Ueno boasts the zoo that shares its name, as well as many national museums, art galleries, parks and performing arts venues, Akihabara is geek heaven, an electronic wonderland known worldwide for its tech and pop subculture elements such as manga and anime.\n### Don't Miss\n- Strolling through Ueno Park, especially when the cherry trees are in bloom\n- The quirky maid and manga cafes of Akihabara\n- Ueno's bustling Ameyoko shopping street, full of bargains\n## How to Get There\nUeno Station and Akihabara Station are the best places to start exploring this area. Both are major stops on the JR Yamanote Line. Akihabara is two stations from Tokyo Station and is followed by Okachimachi and Ueno stations.\nUeno, Akihabara, Yanesen Yanesen, Hongo and Kanda Myojin are all within walking distance of each other.\n### Where nature, art, culture, and history intersect\nUeno is a neighborhood known for its namesake zoo, Japan's oldest, and its giant pandas. The zoo also features the \"Gorilla Woods\" and \"Tiger Forests,\" where they are attempting to breed endangered species.\nThe magnificent Ueno Toshogu Shrine enshrines the first Tokugawa shogun, Ieyasu, and is famed for its displays of peonies and dahlias in the Botan Garden.\nUeno Park has a lake you can cruise around on, a forest, and an art museum and gallery. From its origins as the private grounds of Kaneiji Temple, through samurai wars, Imperial ownership, and today as a public park, Ueno Park has remained a central gathering spot in Tokyo.\nPhoto credit: Japanese Gallery (Honkan)\n### Walking from Ueno to Akihabara\nAmeya Yokocho, or Ameyoko as it is usually called, is a bargain hunter's dream.

This is also Tokyo's undisputed center of electronics and tech, but it's the pop culture icons that dominate the visual landscape. J-pop artists frequent the area to meet fans and be seen.\n### A shrine with an anime mascot\nNearby Kanda-jinja Shrine, popularly known as Kanda Myojin, blends elements of tradition and pop culture. Because of its proximity to Akihabara, many young people and manga artists pray for good fortune at Kanda Myojin. You can see their art on wooden wish plaques, called ema, hanging at the shrine.\n### Edo meets chic style\nHongo and the area known as Yanesen—comprised of Yanaka, Nezu, and Sendagi—form a hilly residential neighborhood that is unusual in Tokyo. It's a rare part of Tokyo that has remained largely intact since before World War II and known as shitamachi, the city's old downtown.\nMany of the old buildings have been renovated, presenting a chic version of the old downtown architecture that once dominated the city.\nA new generation of young people have discovered Yanesen and love its unique balance of old and new. A mix of small inns, modern tea houses, wagashi patisseries and art gallery workspaces are transforming Yanesen without destroying its traditional charm.\nThe University of Tokyo, a giant institution with Imperial origins, is remarkable for its role in the background of this transformation. Todai's students and faculty have embraced Yanesen's revitalization.\n### Take your time to get lost\nWhether you're a fan of old or new, you can see another side of Japan here, far from the shiny tourist facilities.

Fuji富士登山\nMount Fuji, Fujinomiya-shi, Shizuoka-ken\n## The high point of a visit to Japan\nClimbing Mt. Fuji was once viewed as a religious pilgrimage to honor the spirit of what is one of the most beautiful and iconic peaks on the planet. An endeavor famed for its natural beauty and cultural significance, getting to the top of Mt. Fuji is an experience unlike any other.\n### Quick Facts\nMt. Fuji is actually a volcano but hasn't been active since 1707\nSaturdays tend to be the most crowded and the summit at sunrise is packed\n## How to Get There\nThere are various ways to get to the three trailheads for Mt. Fuji on the Shizuoka side by train and bus.\nTake a bus from Gotemba Station (on the JR Gotemba Line) to the Subashiri trailhead at the 5th Station, or the Gotemba New 5th Station Trailhead.\n### Choose your route up Mt. Fuji\nThere are four routes up to the peak: the Subashiri trail, the Fujinomiya trail, the Gotemba trail, and the Yoshida trail. All trails begin at what's known as the fifth station. Trails open on July 10 (except the Yoshida trail, which opens July 1), and close on September 10, although the dates may change depending on snow conditions. Each trail has its quirks, and they are all color-coded to keep you on track.\n### Stay warm, safe and on track\nIt may be steamy and hot when you begin climbing, but the summit can be rainy, windy and below freezing—even in summer. Bring warm waterproof clothes and plenty of water. Save some stamina for the trail down, too, because the incline and loose volcanic rock can be difficult to handle. Injuries are more likely while descending.\n### Catch the sunrise at the summit\nYou can climb Mt. Fuji during the daytime when the temperature is the warmest, but the best time to stand at its peak is during the sunrise. To catch the sunrise at Mt. Fuji, you can either hike from the middle of the night or stay in one of the mountain huts. With the night hike, you can avoid the hot summer sun and also enjoy the sunrise as you go up. Reservations are needed for the hut stay, and you should keep in mind that women and men share the hut in close quarters.\nSunrise on Mt. Fuji is a breathtaking experience. The sun first makes its appearance on the eastern horizon. Standing far above the clouds it's unlike any sunrise you've ever seen.\nThe latest information may differ, so please check the official website\n## Keywords"}

One unique feature of Oarai Isosaki-jinja is that statues of frogs guard the entrance to the shrine, in place of the usual guardian komainu lion-dogs.

Though long defunct, parts of the mine have been transformed into the Oya History Museum, this underground realm now a site offering a one-of-a-kind exploration.\n### Don't miss\n- The mine's mysterious dream-like caverns\n- Nearby Oyaji Temple, carved out of a cliff face\n## How to Get There\nBuses run to the Oya History Museum from Utsunomiya Station.\nFrom the west side of Utsunomiya Station, take the bus at stop six heading for Oya/Tateiwa. The ride will take about 30 minutes. Get off at the Shiryokaniriguchi stop; the museum is a three-minute walk.\n### A rock for the ages\nCreated from lava and ash, igneous Oya stone is easily carvable, resistant to erosion, and has been used in Japan since the 17th century for everything from tombs to paving stones to Tokyo's Imperial Hotel. Its use declined dramatically with the spread of concrete.\nThe Oya History Museum opened in 1979, giving the quarries a new direction. The last mines closed in 1986, but the museum continues to thrive as one of Utsunomiya's most popular destinations.\nA small building houses oya stone-related exhibits, but the real draw is the massive underground network of caverns with more than 20,000 square meters of open space. Exhibits along the walls explain local geology and the history and methods of oya quarrying.\n### Not your ordinary mine\nWalking underground through such open spaces is a rare experience. Artwork is displayed throughout the mine, and many of the rooms are illuminated with various colors, creating a sometimes surreal atmosphere.\nEvent spaces have also been carved into the caverns; these host weddings and concerts, and have become popular as sets for music videos, commercials, and films.\nTwo hours is about enough time to fully explore the museum. Deep underground, the air is cool, even during summer, so make sure you have something warm to wear.\n### After your underground adventure\nOutside the museum, Rockside Market has a cafe with tasty ice cream and a gift shop to help you ease back into the surface light and air.\nNearby Oyaji Temple is a ten-minute walk from the museum and worth a visit. Over 1,200 years old, the temple is built into a towering section of exposed oya stone. It is dedicated to Kannon, the Buddhist goddess of mercy. A visit here offers a rare glimpse at some of Japan's oldest Buddhist carvings.\nTake a moment to admire the colossal statue of Kannon across the street from the temple. It was carved as a monument to peace after WWII.\n## Keywords"}

It is a bronze statue of Amida Buddha and is second only in height to Todaiji's Great Buddha in Nara.\nLike the statue in Nara, the Daibutsu was originally housed inside a temple building after its casting in the 13th century. However, in the 14th and 15th centuries, the hall was repeatedly destroyed by typhoons, tsunami and earthquakes. So, in 1498, the Amida's carers caved in to the inevitable and left the statue exposed to the elements.\nSince then it has stood, implacable, the venerable symbol of Kamakura.\n©Kamakura City Tourist Association\n### The Pure Land\nThe Kamakura Daibutsu sits in the grounds of Kotokuin, a temple belonging to the Jodo Sect of Buddhism. The Jodo are committed to the liberation of all beings, meaning the Great Buddha is there for all: saints and sinners, rich and poor, young and old. An equal opportunities Buddha, guiding all to the Pure Land.\n©Kamakura City Tourist Association\n### Have warazori and willing to travel\nThe highlight of any visit is standing inside the Great Buddha itself, listening to the muted world carrying on outside.\nTo the right of the Buddha hangs a pair of 1.8 meter-long warazori straw sandals. Originally woven by children in 1951 in the hope that the Buddha would use them to walk the length and breadth of Japan, they are renewed every three years by children from the same club.\n### An entrance of kings\nOther sites of interest include Niomon gate, the richly colored entrance where the temple's two protecting Deva Kings reside.\nBehind the Buddha stands Kangetsudo Hall which started life as part of the imperial palace in 15th-century Seoul before being moved first to Tokyo and then to Kamakura. It contains an Edo period (1603-1867) image of Kannon Bosatsu, the Goddess of Mercy.\nKotokuin is very well set up for visitors of restricted mobility, with a well signposted barrier-free route. Tickets to Kotokuin cost 200 yen, with an additional 20 yen charge to go inside the Buddha.\nPlan to spend 30 minutes to see the Kamakura Daibutsu and the other treasures at Kotokuin Temple without feeling rushed.

These scenic gardens, once reserved for Imperial use only, were opened to the public in 1946.\nWhen you visit these gardens, leave time for traditional refreshment in the floating teahouse, a quintessential Japanese experience, and consider departing via waterbus.\n### Don't Miss\n- The only seawater pond left in a garden from the Edo period in Tokyo\n- Matcha green tea and traditional sweets served in the Nakajima-no-ochaya (teahouse)\n- Strolling the 120-meter bridge that connects the gardens' islands\n## How to Get There\nYou can access the gardens via a 12-minute walk from Shimbashi Station.\nAlternatively, the gardens are a 7-minute walk from Shiodome Station on the Oedo Subway Line or Yurikamome Line.\nThe gardens are a stop for the waterbus run by Tokyo Cruise Ship Co., Ltd. The Sumida River Line waterbus runs from Asakusa to the gardens, and the 35-minute trip makes a refreshing change to the subway. The entrance fee to the grounds is included in the fare. You can also travel back to Asakusa via the gardens' Hinode Pier.\n### Many aspects of the gardens\nWhile you relax in the gardens' natural beauty, there are many points of interest for you to explore. Near the entrance is an impressive 300-year-old pine tree very carefully pruned over the centuries into an impressive weeping expanse, and beyond that are flower fields which offer nearly year-round blooms including vibrant peonies, colza, and cosmos.\nThe gardens have two duck hunting grounds that were used by the Shogun, and there is a memorial built to commemorate and console the spirits of the ducks that have been caught in the grounds. You can still see traditional duck blinds from behind which the ducks were shot scattered throughout Hama-rikyu.\n### Beautiful seasonal blossoms and foliage\nCompared to some of Tokyo's other gardens, Hama-rikyu is not known for its spring blossoms and autumn foliage. However, from late February to early April you can view blossoms, as the gardens still house an abundance of plum and cherry blossom trees blooming in pink and white during spring. The same is true in the autumn, as the maple and ginkgo trees illuminate the garden in dazzling reds and yellows.\n### A small sea\nThe gardens' central pond, Shioiri-no-ike, is more than it seems. With its Japanese name translating to \"tidal pond,\" the pond is actually filled with seawater drawn in from Tokyo Bay. Sluice gates are used to regulate the water level by working with the rise and fall of the tide, so the pond changes throughout the day. Make sure to look into the pond when you visit as you may catch a glimpse of the marine life brought in from the sea, including sea bass and black mullet.\nAppearing to float on the pond is the teahouse. Here, sitting in these traditional surroundings on the tatami mats, you can enjoy a relaxing cup of powdered green tea served with an authentic wagashi sweet. If you don't have time for tea, the atmosphere alone provides a rewarding experience.\n### After the gardens\nDue to its location along the Tokyo Waterbus Line, Hama-rikyu makes for a great stop between a visit to Asakusa's traditional temples and Odaiba's ultra-modern entertainment. Traveling the city this way is a lovely, scenic alternative to the underground subway lines.\n## Keywords"}

Once a feudal lord's domain, it later became the imperial garden for the imperial family, nobles and invited guests. While Yoyogi Park, the Imperial Palace, and other temples and shrines offer green spaces, none of them can match Shinjuku Gyoen, which covers a massive 144 acres and continues to be one of the best places to visit in Tokyo.\n### Don't Miss\n- The three distinct styles of gardens\n- The greenhouse, with flora both tropical and subtropical\n- The iconic pergola featured in the film The Garden of Words\n## How to Get There\nShinjuku Gyoen is easily accessible on foot from either Shinjuku Station, Sendagaya Station or Shinjuku Gyoemmae Station.\nFrom Shinjuku Station, the Southeast Exit is the closest to Shinjuku Gyoen. It takes approximately 10 minutes on foot.\nShinjuku Gyoen Management Office\n### Three ways to view the gardens\nShinjuku Gyoen National Garden is really three gardens in one, with western and Japanese-style gardens.\nThe French style formal area is considered the most romantic. This is because of the abundant flowers, especially roses. This part of the garden is especially popular in the spring when the majority of the flowers bloom. You can also see hundreds of trees changing colors before the cold winter months. The English style garden features expansive open lawns surrounded by flowering cherry trees.\nThe Japanese garden is an integral part of the garden's origins, with large ponds dotted with islands and bridges. Well-manicured shrubs and trees surround the water together with a tea-house and pavilion. While beautiful year-round, this garden should not be missed in spring and fall.\n### Imperial origins\nThe garden was originally built as the private residence of Lord Naito—an Edo era (1603-1867) feudal lord. In 1906, the garden was converted into a imperial garden by the Meiji government.\nDuring WWII, the garden was destroyed during the air raids. Once restored, the garden was converted into a public garden.\nThe garden remains associated with the Imperial Family. The Showa Emperor (1901-1989) considered Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden such an important part of his childhood that his funeral was held here as an official state ceremony on February 24, 1989.\n### Cherry blossom season\nIf you're in Tokyo during sakura season, Shinjuku Gyoen is a beautiful place to experience Japanese hanami (viewing the cherry blossoms), when approximately 1,000 cherry trees color the garden in many shades of pink. Bring along a picnic lunch and join the fun. Hanami is a truly Japanese experience.\nKeep in mind, however, that the garden prohibits alcohol consumption. Because of this, the garden is a popular cherry-blossom viewing choice for those with babies and children.\n### More to see and do\nThe Taiwan Pavilion is an authentic Chinese structure built to celebrate the Emperor Showa Hirohito's wedding, paid for by Japanese people living in Taiwan at the time.\nThe greenhouse at Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden looks like a glassed-in indoor jungle. This botanical garden features orchids, unusual plants from the subtropics, plants in danger of extinction, large trees, ponds and waterfalls. It's divided into pond, tropical, subtropical and desert areas.\n### Recreate anime scenes\nMakoto Shinkai's 2013 anime film, The Garden of Words, is set in Shinjuku Gyoen. He made the film from a desire to preserve the beauty of the garden in the event of a natural disaster, based on his feelings after the Great East Japan Earthquake and tsunami of 2011.\nMany scenes in the film use Shinkai's photos as the base for the illustrations. A majority of the film's action takes place at one small pavilion in the garden. If you're a Shinkai fan, the area makes for a perfect photo opportunity.\nPlease note: No alcoholic beverages and no play equipment are allowed in the garden. Please check the official website of the Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden before you visit.\n## Keywords"}

His private collections form the majority of the museum's pieces.\nDuring the war bombings in 1945, the museum's collections were evacuated, and survived the devastating fires which destroyed the original museum buildings. Thanks to this, the museum was able to reopen in 1946. Located on the site of the former Nezu family residence, the museum was renewed in 2009 by famous Japanese architect Kengo Kuma.\n### Truly diverse collections\nWhen the doors were first opened in 1941, the museum boasted 4,642 works of art, all sourced from Nezu's personal collection.\nAs the years went on, the collection expanded through acquisitions and donations, and now houses 7,600 works of art. Nezu's approach to art appreciation was all-encompassing, and as a result, the museum features gorgeous pre-modern paintings, ceramics, armor, textiles, woodwork and more from across Japan, China, and East Asia, with some pieces dating back over 3,000 years. Here, you can get a glimpse of a truly representative body of Asian art.\n### New experiences with ever-changing exhibits\nThe galleries house both a permanent collection and a rotating cast of exhibits, so no matter what time of year you visit or whether you've been before, there's always something new to explore within the museum's walls.\nThe Nezu Museum's well-maintained English website hosts a list of upcoming and past exhibits, giving you a good idea of what to expect and look forward to during your visit.\n### Secret gardens and traditional tea\nOutside the gallery walls is the almost-hidden Nezu Garden, one of Tokyo's best spots to unwind. The 17,000 square meters of rolling hills and trees make for a true oasis in the middle of fast-paced Tokyo. The garden has been carefully landscaped to embody the natural beauty of the Japanese mountains, and includes four very distinctive tearooms.\nAlthough the tearooms aren't open to the public, you can still have a relaxing drink in picturesque surroundings by visiting the beautifully designed Nezucafe, which features modern Japanese architecture and full-length picture windows framing the gardens outside.

The shrines range in size from the three huge mikoshi of Asakusa Shrine to cute miniature versions carried by neighborhood children.\n### Friday events\nThe festival begins with the Daigyoretsu Parade on Friday afternoon. A parade of priests, geisha, and officials all wearing Edo-period costumes walk in procession from Yanagi-dori Street to Asakusa Shrine, accompanied by musicians riding on decorated floats while playing flutes and drums. After a Shinto prosperity ceremony, the first portable shrines start jostling through the streets and the party starts.\n### Saturday events\nSaturday is dedicated to the blessing of almost 100 neighborhood mikoshi. Visitors can start to see them carried out around noon for ceremonies at Sensoji Temple and Asakusa Shrine. Once the blessing is complete, the teams ramp up their energy and go parading through the area to bring luck and prosperity to their neighborhoods.\n### Sunday events\nThe Sanja Festival starts early on the final day when carriers from across the area gather at Asakusa Shrine and compete to carry one of shrine's three large main mikoshi. Things can get a bit heated, so for safety reasons spectators are not allowed through Sensoji's gates during this part of the festival.\nOnce the battles for those prized spots calms down, the gold-covered shrines are danced and bounced through Asakusa's decorated streets until 8:00 p.m., when the festivities start to wind down.\nThroughout the entire festival, Asakusa is filled with food stalls, festival games, and the lively sounds of traditional drums and flutes.\n## Keywords"}

Everyone just says Ameyoko.\nAmeyoko became a huge marketplace after World War II. It started as a black market, selling many things that people who worked for the Occupation forces would get from the soldiers. It's uncertain how it came to be called Ameyoko.\nThere are still a lot of sweets sold here.\nThe intersection near Ueno Station\n### What is tatakiuri?\nThere is a chocolate shop near the Ueno end of Ameyoko that sells in an unusual manner, almost like an auction. Tatakiuri literally means bang-selling. Vendors will often hit something, like boxes, with a stick, as they sell.\nHere, the seller will add boxes of chocolate into the bag. He'll keep adding them until the bag is full. No matter how many he adds, the bag sells for 1,000 yen.\n### Let's negotiate the price!\nSome stores offer cheap prices, and you can also negotiate the price on the spot.\nSporting goods are often sold this way, and the brands are real, not knock-offs, although they may be from two or three seasons past. It's a true bargain.\n### Look for the fruit vendors\nThere are many fruit vendors that sell fruit on a stick. Melons, strawberries and pineapple are common, but the fruits are whatever is in season and ripe.\nThere is so much more to see and do. If you're visiting friends, the crab, salmon roe, and other seafood are always appreciated as gifts. Or the matsutake mushrooms. These are always cheaper than in many stores.\nThe latest information may differ, so please check the official website\n## Keywords"}

Located in a secluded valley in the Tochigi Mountains, Okukinu is home to four notable hot springs, each of which is worth a visit.\n### Don't miss\n- The four ryokan of Okukinu\n- The Yunishigawa Kamakura Festival\n## How to Get There\nBus is the only way to reach Okukinu. Cars are banned on the roads past Meotobuchi Onsen for environmental protection reasons.\nFrom Meotobuchi Onsen, you must ride a bus bound for the ryokan (Japanese inn) you've reserved with. Anyone not staying the night at a ryokan will have to hike from Meotobuchi for about two hours, a hike that can be dangerous in the colder months. Once you've arrived in the area, all of the onsen are a walkable distance from each other, and it is possible to visit all four in a single day.\n### The four ryokan of Okukinu\nThere are four ryokan in Okukinu and each has its own charms. The ryokan offer shuttle services to nearby outdoor activities such as hiking trails, fishing spots, and viewpoints. For details, check with the inn you are staying at.\n### Hatcho-no-Yu\nOne of the most popular of the four ryokan. Great heaps of snow cover the mountain slopes surrounding the ryokan during winter. The ryokan has segregated and mixed bathing facilities.\n### Kaniyu\nAlso very popular, Kaniyu is situated beside a small mountain river. Kaniyu offers a broad selection of hot springs both in terms of size and location and there are both indoor and outdoor baths on site. Be sure to find the bath that best suits you! There are some good hikes around Kaniyu, and it is well worth exploring the immediate area.\n### Nikkozawa\nNikkozawa is a very old inn made entirely from wood. The aged and weathered wood is part of its charm. The onsen water here is said to feel very soft and smooth on the skin. From the inn, you can get great views of the steep slopes of the Tochigi Mountains.\n### Teshirosawa\nTeshirosawa is the smallest of the hot springs in Okukinu, but offers splendid panoramic views. Its location is breathtaking, surrounded by steep mountains. The inn has only six rooms and four hot springs and guarantees a relaxing getaway, if only you can get a room!\n### The Yunishigawa Kamakura Festival\nIf you are in the Okukinu area between January and March, it is worth visiting the Yunishigawa Kamakura Festival in the town of Yunishigawa Onsen.

Here you can find live theater and music, as well as trendy cafes and retro culture.\n### Don't Miss\n- Book shopping with a beer at B&B\n- Some of Tokyo's best up-and-coming live bands at Shimokitazawa THREE\n## How to Get There\nShimokitazawa is easily accessible from Shinjuku and Shibuya Stations.\nIf you're visiting from the Shinjuku area, catch the Odakyu line from Shinjuku Station and get off at Shimokitazawa. From Shibuya, catch the Keio Inokashira Line from Shibuya Station. This ride is a little shorter, getting you to the station in four to five minutes on the express train.\n### Quick Facts\nShimokita is home to Tokyo's independent music, theater, comedy, and film scenes\nThe area has one of the largest concentrations of thrift stores in all of Tokyo\nThe narrow, winding streets date back to the area's farming roots before cars were commonplace\n### A historical escape from the city\nShimokitazawa as it is today found its start following the devastation of the 1921 Great Kanto Earthquake. Formerly home to the city's farming population, after the disaster people moved to the district for a little more peace of mind. Following World War II, the suburb became the adopted home and market hub for U.S. Soldiers.\nThanks to its now well-connected central location and comparatively lower rent, \"Shimokita\" has become increasingly popular with young students and creatives wanting to start their own enterprises and live in the city without the pressures of big city life.\n### Vintage shopping for every interest\nIf there's one thing Shimokita is most famous for, it has to be its vintage antiques and retro thrift shopping boutiques. Whether it's used records or books, high-end vintage or cheap second-hand clothing, if you're chasing a chance at a deal you can find it here.\nThe area is home to many independent and chain store thrift boutiques whose abundant wares often overflow onto the well-trodden paths. Given the sheer amount of what's on offer, it's best not to plan too much when shopping in Shimokitazawa. However, some names you can't miss in this thrift-seekers paradise are Flamingo, Joe's New York Exchange, and Chicago, all of which house carefully organized racks of clothing to suit every style and subculture under the sun.\nShimokita is home to Village Vanguard's flagship store, where you'll find clothing, accessories, toys and more all dedicated to vintage nostalgia and hip counterculture.\n### Center for coffee culture\nBeyond clothing, Shimokitazawa also has some of the best coffee shops in all of Tokyo. Check out some of the specialty coffee hotspots while you're wandering through the area, including the historic Moldive, world-famous Bear Pond Espresso.\nFor something a little heartier, the area is also home to an eclectic collection of cafes and restaurants that serve everything from Okinawan Tex-Mex, Canadian fast food, avocado dishes while sitting in hammocks, and of course plenty of Japanese pub-style dishes. While Omotesando has high-end luxury cafes, this area is all about relaxed, down-to-earth dining with an undeniable eye for quality.\n### Tokyo's live music destination\nThanks to the area's thriving, youth-driven arts culture, Shimokitazawa has also become one of Tokyo's premier live music hubs. With a collection of different sized venues dotted across the streets, it has something for everyone.\nOne milestone on many new bands' must-do lists is a performance at the revered Shimokitazawa THREE, a small and cozy dive bar that features a rotating cast of bigger indie names and new upstarts. Second only to the neighboring suburb of Koenji, the home of Japanese punk, you'll find in Shimokita a wealth of well-trodden, beer- and whiskey-soaked venues like Club 251, Basement Bar, and Era.\n## Keywords"}

If you want an easily recognizable path out or you're looking for a good meeting spot, head to the Hachiko exit, which is the closest to Shibuya crossing.\n### Quick Facts\nThe village of Shibuya was formed in 1889, having been a castle town since the 11th century\nShibuya extends all the way out to fashion-famous Harajuku and Omotesando\nOver 2,500 pedestrians cross Shibuya Crossing every two minutes during peak hours\n### A mix of people and cultures\nUnlike the neighboring areas of Aoyama, Harajuku, Omotesando, and Ebisu, central Shibuya doesn't necessarily have a unified culture. With each street as unique as the next, the area is a melting pot of different subcultures, nationalities, and tastes.\nAs masses of tourists and businessmen surge their way through the crossing and trendy teens spend time in nearby shopping centers, Tokyo's fashion elite and top entertainers weave through the back streets en route to their favorite late-night venues. This melting pot of diverse cultures gives the area a uniquely international feel amidst the bright lights and raucous sounds competing for your attention.\n### The crossing\nIf there were one location that embodied Shibuya, it would, of course, be the iconic Shibuya Crossing. An intersection of a number of main streets located in front of the well-trafficked Shibuya Station, this pedestrian walkway is considered the busiest in the entire world.\nOutside the world's second-busiest train station, this crossing sees an estimated 1,000-2,500 people pass by every two-minute light change. An exercise in organized chaos, it's truly a sight to behold. For a nice view of the action, grab a drink in the Starbucks in the QFRONT building and head to the second floor.\n### Tokyo's most famous dog\nWhen leaving the station from the Hachiko exit, you'll pass the statue of the dog after which the exit is named. This small public square is commonly used as a meeting place and is watched by a memorial of the Akita-ken dog Hachiko whose story of loyalty and love for his owner became a famous contemporary folktale after he waited around 10 years for his late master to return to their usual meeting spot.\n### Top shopping\nWhen it comes to megastores, they don't get much more mega than the skyscrapers that tower over Shibuya's busy walkways. Home to a vast selection of different retail outlets, the one thing unifying Shibuya's many stories of varying stores is their mind-boggling size.\nFrom iconic fashion outlets like Shibuya 109 and Uniqlo to oversized lifestyle stores like Don Quijote, Tokyu Hands, and Muji, if you want to shop for all of Japan's latest and greatest, this is the place to do it.\nTower Records eye-catching red and yellow flagship store is also an excellent stop for music-lovers eager to discover Japan's current hits.\n### Famous streets\nThanks to its cultural diversity, Shibuya is home to a weaving network of unique streets and hidden walkways.\nLocated behind Hachiko Square is Center Gai, the major pedestrian thoroughfare that runs through Shibuya's main shopping, entertainment and retail district. Running alongside it is Dogenzaka, the other main street lined with more major shopping, dining and some of Tokyo's best nightclubs like Womb, Club Camelot, and Sound Vision Museum.\nThere are many other small pockets dotted throughout the immediate area, such as the love hotel district Love Hill and Spain-zaka (Spain Hill), named for its resemblance to winding Spanish steps and overflowing with small shops and restaurants.\nWherever you wind up, you should definitely devote one of your evenings in Tokyo to wandering through Shibuya and seeing everything it offers.\n## Keywords"}

This area is known for its friendly vibe, retro charm and narrow byways full of small shops, bars, and restaurants. When Tokyoites get nostalgic and want to experience life at a more congenial pace, they often head for Yanesen and shitamachi.\n### Don't Miss\n- SCAI The Bathhouse—it's not what you think\n- The unusual architecture of Nezu-jinja Shrine\n## How to Get There\nThe Yanesen area is served by both metro subway lines and Japan Railways.\nYanesen is really three different places: Yanaka, Nezu, and Sendagi. Along with neighboring Hongo, which is nearby and similar, these four areas are typical shitamachi.\nTo get directly to Yanesen, take the Metro Chiyoda Line to either Nezu or Sendagi stations.\nAlternatively, take the JR Yamanote Line to Sendagi.\n### Taste shitamachi flavors\nThere is much to see in Yanesen, but one of the best ways to get to know shitamachi is to sample its food. Shitamachi has hearty, \"no fuss\" fare, like menchi katsu, a deep-fried minced meat cutlet, and tendon, battered and deep-fried seafood and vegetables on a bowl of rice. Yanaka Ginza is a shopping arcade that is typical of shitamachi, and you can find many such dishes here.\nIf you're a coffee lover, try some of the lovingly made brews at traditional coffee shops known as kissaten. There are many of them in the Yanesen area.\n### For your sweet tooth\nThere are a number of cafes and Japanese sweet shops here as well. Daifuku—sweet beans wrapped in soft mochi—are the most common.\nAmezaiku is another local treat. The word Amezaiku means \"candy craft,\" or making candy objects. The craftsperson heats up the candy and deftly shapes it into a bird, cat or even Godzilla. The art has been around for hundreds of years and is usually found at some matsuri and other festivals. Yanesen has a shop, Amezaiku Yoshihara, that makes and sells amezaiku every day.\n### A one-of-a-kind art gallery\nSCAI the Bathhouse is an art gallery specializing in contemporary art. It is housed in a bathhouse that has been reformed and has a history of more than 200 years. You should definitely stop by SCAI.\n### One of Tokyo's most venerable shrines\nNezu-jinja Shrine is one of Tokyo's oldest shrines. Its tunnel of red torii gates might remind you of the famous Fushimi Inari Taisha Shrine in Kyoto.\nThe amazing structures of the main shrine might look like they belong somewhere else, such as Nikko. When visiting Nezu, the serenity you will experience and the photos you take will make you look forward to more of the same in Kyoto and Nikko.\n## Keywords"}

There are tours of the grounds as well, and you can get in to see the imperial art collection for free.\n### Don't Miss\n- Tours of the inner palace grounds—the only way to see the Emperor's home\n- The seasonal flowers and castle ruins in the East Garden\n- Taking advantage of the free admission to the Imperial art collection\n## How to Get There\nThe outer gardens of the Imperial Palace are extensive, and can be reached from several different gates and metro stations.\nThe Ote-mon gate is a popular option, since it was the main gate of Edo Castle. The gate is a five-minute walk from the Otemachi subway station, or a 15-minute walk from Tokyo Station.\nThe Hirakawamon and Kita-hanebashimon gates are located closer to Kitanomaru Park; both are a five-minute walk from Takebashi Station on the Tozai metro line.\n### Tokyo's own Central Park\nAlthough much smaller than in its heyday, the grounds of the Imperial Palace Gardens are around 115 hectares and are divided into four main parts. Three are open to visitors — the Kokyo Gaien National Garden, Imperial Palace East Garden and Kitanomaru Park. The inner palace area can only be visited on special tours, which depart from the Kikyo-mon Gate.\n### Japanese gardens and woodlands surrounded by skyscrapers\nEach of the three gardens has its own character. Kokyo Gaien National Garden is the most urban, offering views of the towering skyscrapers of busy Marunouchi that contrast with the Meiji era (1868-1912) Nijubashi bridge and black pines.\nHousing Ninomaru—an Edo period (1603-1867) garden—the East Garden are a delightful secret park filled with blooming flowers, ancient walls and the elegant Suwano teahouse.

For travel within Hokkaido, there are direct flights from Sapporo (New Chitose Airport) to Memanbetsu Airport and Nemuro Nakashibetsu Airport, the two closest to Shiretoko.\nLocal public transit is scarce, so it's best to see the area by car (or rental car). However, there is an overnight bus from Sapporo that takes you to the Shiretoko area's main bus terminals and hotels.\n### Pristine natural beauty at Shiretoko National Park\nShiretoko National Park is a UNESCO World Heritage Site set in the magnificent mountains and steep cliffs of the northern tip of the Shiretoko Peninsula.\nFrom spring to autumn, you can admire the serene five lakes known collectively as Shiretoko Goko, follow hiking trails to hidden waterfalls, or take a nature cruise from Utoro for the chance to see brown bears leading their cubs along the shore, as well as some of the many species of whales, dolphins, and seals that thrive in the nutrient-rich waters. In winter, take a cruise from Rausu to observe white-tailed sea eagles and Stellar's sea eagles. Or participate in a \"drift ice walk tour,\" where you wear a dry suit and walk on drift ice. The opportunity to dive under the ice floes is a unique winter experience in Shiretoko.\n### The tip of the iceberg\nThe Shiretoko area is much larger than just the national park and offers some wonderful surprises for the adventurous. Drive 50 kilometers south along the beautiful coast road from Rausu, and you will come to the entrance to Notsuke Peninsula, a long sandbar reaching out into the Nemuro Strait.\nTake a stroll to admire the dramatic landscape of sunken forests, grazing deer, wildfowl and native flowers. The imposing Kunashiri Island sits just a few miles across the waters.\nIn winter, you can see miles of drift ice floating south on the currents toward Nemuro and Cape Nosappu. Halfway between Notsuke and Nemuro is Lake Furenko, a mecca for birdwatchers. Roughly 300 species of wild birds are regular visitors here, so take all your camera gear to get some memorable snaps of Steller's sea eagles and Japanese red-crowned cranes.\n### Relaxing waters and mountain views\nHead inland and away from the choppy waters of the Nemuro Strait to get the best views of the glorious Shiretoko mountain range stretching out into the distance. Try Kaiyoudai Observatory in Nakashibetsu or Tawadaira Observatory in Shibecha for the best views.\nEnd your day with a hot soak and delicious dinner at secluded Yoroushi Onsen.\n### Rich and delicious fish\nIt's no wonder that so many bears, whales, dolphins, and birds thrive on and around the Shiretoko Peninsula. The waters are replenished annually by rich nutrients deposited by the drift ice, meaning you get to try some of the best local seafood in Japan.\nAs a starter, try some uni (sea urchin) and hokke (Atka mackerel) in Utoro and Rausu; follow up with some ikura (salmon roe), shrimp and scallop in Odaito; and there's always room for some Hanasaki crab from Nemuro and its famous sanma (Pacific saury).\n## Keywords"}

Exiting from Harajuku Station, you'll immediately see lines of colorful stores selling everything from giant-sized rainbow cotton candy and colorful accessories to spiked leather jackets and piles of clothing overflowing onto the street.\nJam-packed with local teenagers and tourists alike, Takeshita Street is a fascinating melting pot of cultures, styles, and tastes that's sure to give you an interesting new souvenir to wear home.\n### Satisfy your sweet tooth\nOn almost every corner are Harajuku's famous crepe stalls pumping out delicious wafting scents. A must-eat for visitors to the area, these made-to-order crepes consist of a thin eggy batter expertly folded with the fillings of your choice. Whether you're after a classic-style strawberry and cream, or a more decadent cheesecake-filled wrap, there's something for every sweet or savory taste.\nThese crepes are essentially Harajuku's culinary staple, and you can't leave without taking one for yourself and strolling the street as you eat.\n### Streetwear sneaker paradise\nHarajuku is arguably Tokyo's streetwear capital, and what's streetwear without sneakers? No matter your style, budget, or size, you can find an incredible selection in Harajuku's somewhat hidden sneaker district at the end of Takeshita and across the street.\nStores that call the area home include more mainstream names like Atmos, Billy's, and Kick's Lab, but if you're hoping for something more obscure, be sure to check out Fool's Judge, a resale store that regularly stocks the most sought-after sneaker releases.\n### Taking to the backstreets\nThanks to its global impact on the fashion world, the main shopping streets of Harajuku have become a tourist hotspot. Though the atmosphere here can be fun for exploring, if you really want to immerse yourself in the authentic culture of Harajuku's street scene, don't be afraid to wander away from the main thoroughfare.\nIf you head towards Omotesando from Harajuku Station, you'll find a network of roads connecting some of the most impressive high-end, vintage and big-name fashion outlets in all of Tokyo. Mega streetwear names like Bape and Supreme have flagship stores here in this pocket between Harajuku and high-end Omotesando. Crossing the street and heading between Kiddy Land and the Gyre shopping center, you'll find yourself in the quieter, pedestrian-friendly Cat Street, home to some of the area's trendiest shops and cafes.\n## Keywords"}

The trees are illuminated and festive food and drinks are on sale along the river. Night viewing adds a different dimension to traditional cherry blossom viewing.\n### Timing is everything\nYou can usually count on trees blooming around late March in Tokyo, but be aware that the timing varies each year. An annual cherry blossom forecast is released by the government leading up to spring.\n### Viewing etiquette\nNakameguro is a residential area, and becomes crowded during cherry blossom season. Take care not to leave trash such as food and drink containers or walk onto the busy road. Be considerate of others when taking photos, and try to keep noise to a minimum, especially at night.\n## Keywords"}

Six tournaments are held in Japan each year, with three in Tokyo, held in January, May and September. Each tournament lasts around 15 days, giving visitors a reasonable chance of getting tickets. Ryogoku Kokugikan is Tokyo's sumo stadium, a short walk from Ryogoku Station in eastern Tokyo. During tournament season, the area is decorated with colorful flags, and people gather to catch a glimpse of their favorite wrestlers, from up-and-comers to yokozuna (grand champions).\n### Don't Miss\n- Trying a bowl of chanko nabe, a rich stew traditionally eaten by sumo wrestlers\n- Sampling sake and yakitori at the sumo stadium\n- Watching the arrival of the high-ranking wrestlers in the afternoon\n## How to Get There\nThe stadium is two minutes walk from the West Exit of Ryogoku Station on the JR Sobu Line or a five-minute walk from the Oedo Line exits of the same station.\nDuring tournament season the station can get quite crowded, so arriving early is recommended.\n### The basics of sumo tournaments\nThe sumo tournaments at Ryogoku Kokugikan start quite early, at around eight in the morning. The order of the bouts begins from the lowest-ranked wrestlers and progresses until the big matches between top-ranked athletes.\nBy late afternoon, the entire hall is packed with excited fans waiting to witness the final bout between the top contenders, called musubi-no-ichiban.\nThe rules of sumo are straightforward: the first wrestler to set foot outside of the ring or to touch the inside of the ring with any part of his body except his feet is the loser.\n### Banners generate excitement\nYou will notice colorful banners being paraded around the ring before a match. These are prizes sponsors offer to the wrestlers. The more banners you see, the more hyped-up the match.\n### Types of seating\nRingside seats are limited and even a bit dangerous, as there is always the chance a wrestler will fall out of the ring.\nMasu-seki, box seats which can fit up to four people, give you a close-up view of the matches, and you can enjoy snacks and drinks while cheering on the wrestlers.\nArena seats on the second level are more affordable for casual visitors.\n### Getting sumo tournament tickets\nYou can book box and arena seats from the Nihon Sumo Kyokai official site. It is best to reserve seats as early as possible, particularly if you want to get a box seat. Alternatively, you can look for a tour that includes tickets for the matches.\n## Keywords"}

Please follow the traffic regulations around the venues, or block or sit in traffic.\n### Delighting visitors since the 18th century\nThe Sumidagawa Fireworks Festival is said to have originated from the Ryogoku Kawaki-no-Kiraki Fireworks launched by the 8th shogun, Tokugawa Yoshimune, in 1733 to pray for the end of a famine and to ward off evil spirits. It is considered the oldest fireworks festival on record. It is one of Tokyo's largest and most urban fireworks displays and the view of the colorful lights surrounding Tokyo Skytree is particularly stunning. Pyrotechnic companies compete to show off their finest works, often introducing new types of fireworks during the event.\n### Tips for enjoying the Sumidagawa fireworks\nThe best place to see the fireworks is by the river, but it is usually quite crowded, as nearly a million people visit each year. It is recommended to wear comfortable clothes that make it easy to walk while viewing fireworks. Maps are available on the festival website but in Japanese only.\n## Keywords"}

The sweeping grasslands of the area are scattered with white limestone mounds and conical sinkholes. The Karst extends along rolling mountains and has multiple trails with expansive panoramas of the Shikoku region and the Pacific Ocean.\n### Don't Miss\n- The mossy trails and ancient trees of Keyakidaira\n- Other-worldly stargazing opportunities\n- Scenic hikes and stunning seasonal blooms\n## How to Get There\nHard to reach by public transport and therefore suited to intrepid travelers, this pristine natural hideout can be accessed by car from Kochi and Matsuyama or a combination of taxi, bus and train travel from Kochi Station.\nIf you choose to rent a car, the scenic drive from either Kochi or Matsuyama takes around two hours. The journey by public transport and taxi requires a number of changes.\nTo get there via public transport, depart from Kochi Station and arrive at Susaki Station to catch a bus towards Yusuhara. Change again at Shinden and take a taxi to Hoshifuru Village Tengu (formerly Tenguso), in the middle of the Karst. During the winter months, some areas of the Karst become inaccessible due to snow.\n### Quick Facts\nThe area is split into three parts; the Tengu Highland, Keyakidaira and Mezurudaira\nThe karst has an elevation of 1,400 meters\nThe area straddles both Ehime and Kochi prefectures\n### A place for all seasons\nThe Shikoku Karst transitions seamlessly with the seasons. Spring sees the grasses turn a vibrant hue of green. On hikes through the area in summer, you can see lilies all around. Old man of the mountain and forget-me-nots also dot the hillsides.\nRich, vibrant leaves cover the trees during fall months, whilst the grass turns a striking shade of silver. Then in the winter, you may find a dusting of the purest white snow covering the hillsides.\n### Forest bathing\nThe hiking trail in the Tengu Highlands that passes through Tengu Forest is a great way to soak up the area's incredible beauty. Look out for the Japanese cypress wood-chip paths meandering through the forest, which are surrounded by stunning white birch and red pine trees.\nThe walk takes approximately three hours and at the end of it, you are rewarded with fantastic views of the Shikoku mountains and on a clear day, the Pacific Ocean.\n### The great outdoors\nDuring summer months, camping is the perfect way to immerse yourself in the tranquil atmosphere of the Karst. The Mezurudaira area has plenty of campsites where you'll find pastoral scenes of cows lazily grazing. The Karst is so far from any major cities there is little to no light pollution, making it the perfect spot to stargaze.\n### A riot of color\nThe nearby Ogawamine area includes several notable mountains. Kasatori, Ogawamine, Mikawamine, and Ubahodo all reach heights of between 900 and 1,500 meters. In spring, the mountains are carpeted with the bold magenta rhododendron flowers. On a clear day, you can see Mt. Ishizuchi and the Sata Peninsula nearby.\n### Warm hospitality\nIn the midst of the Karst's Highlands sits the Hoshifuru Village Tengu (formerly Tenguso) and Mezuruso Cottages. Taste the flavors of the mountains, such as pheasant and wild boar served alongside the best of seasonal produce.\nHoshifuru Village Tengu has a large bath which looks over the Pacific and the Ishizuchi mountains, and is the perfect place to unwind after a long day of hiking. At Mezuruso, try amago, a red spotted masu trout from the nearby rivers of Kumakogen, cooked on an outdoor charcoal fire. Both accommodations also have campsites.\n### Starlight, waterfalls and fairytale villages\nMuch like Shirakawa-go, the thatched farmhouse village of Kumakogen Furusato Ryoko Mura could have been lifted from a fairytale. The planetarium and observatory offer unimpeded views of the twinkling night skies. Nearby, Omogo Gorge and Goraiko and Gongen waterfalls draw visitors with their clear rippling waters and dense surrounding forest.\n## Keywords"}

Winding through the mountains of Honshu's Kii Peninsula, an area straddling Wakayama, Nara, Osaka and Mie prefectures, it's been walked by pilgrims on their quest for enlightenment for over a millennium.\nModern travelers come to experience moments of quiet contemplation, commune with nature, and go deep into Japan's spiritual history.\n### Don't Miss\n- Treading the same paths as past pilgrims, including ascetics, samurai, emperors, and monks\n- Kumano Nachi-taisha Shrine and its temple, a perfect example of Shinto-Buddhist fusion\n- Taking advantage of the luggage shuttle services along the route so you can trek baggage free\n## How to Get There\nThe pilgrimage trails crisscross the Kii Peninsula, and access depends on your ultimate destination and how far you wish to hike. The main means of transportation to the area are Osaka, Kyoto, and Nagoya using the Kisei Mainline (also known as the Kinokuni line).\nTo access Kumano Nachi Taisha Shrine and Nachi Seigantoji Temple, take a 30-minute bus from Kii-Katsuura Station (on the JR Kinokuni Line) to the parking lot in front of the shrine and temple.\nAccess Kumano Hayatama Taisha via a 15-minute walk from JR Shingu Station, also on the JR Kinokuni Line.\nKumano Hongu Taisha is approximately an hour and 15 minutes from Kii-Tanabe Station (on the JR Kinokuni Line) via Ryujin Bus on the Kumano Hongu Line. Get off at Kumano Hongu Taisha-mae.\n### Quick Facts\nThe entire pilgrimage route is made up of seven trails\nIn 2004 the traditional trails along with their holy mountains were designated a UNESCO World Heritage site\nA mythical three-legged crow is the symbol of the Kumano Kodo, and of Japan's national soccer team\n### Kumano, the dwelling place of the gods\nSince its earliest days, the Kumano region has been regarded as a spiritually powerful area where gods inhabit the very fabric of the natural landscape.\nDuring the Heian Period (794-1185), former emperors began making the arduous trek to the region in search of spiritual enlightenment. The pilgrimage gradually became more widely known from that time.\n### The spiritual triumvirate of Kumano Sanzan\nKumano Sanzan is the collective name for the area's three most sacred shrines: Kumano Hayatama Taisha Shrine, Kumano Nachi Taisha Shrine (including adjoining Nachi Seigantoji Temple) and Kumano Hongu Taisha Shrine.\nTogether they are the sacred center of the Kumano region. Uniquely designed and originally offering separate forms of nature worship, the three eventually merged, becoming a major pilgrimage destination.\n### 99 Oji Shrines as spiritual signposts\nWhile the Kumano Sanzan shrines remain the big draw of the pilgrimage, many smaller shrines are scattered along the route. Known as the 99 Oji Shrines, their purpose is to provide protection and guidance for the wandering pilgrims.\n### Religious harmony through Shinbutsu-shugo\nBefore political policy forced them apart in the late 19th century, Buddhism and Shinto coexisted quite peacefully as Shinbutsu-shugo, a fusion of the two belief systems. Shinto gods were considered to be indigenous manifestations of Buddhist deities. This was the norm in Japan for over a thousand years.\nIn the 19th century, Buddhism was separated from Shinto and many temples and Buddhist statues were destroyed.\nWhile it's relatively rare to find Buddhist and Shinto elements intertwined today, Kumano Nachi Taisha Shrine and the adjoining Nachi Seigantoji Temple illustrate the traditional relationship very well.\n## Keywords"}
