Walking around the garden, you may feel you've gone back centuries in time.\n### Get a panoramic view of the garden from the villa\nOnce you've explored the garden, be sure to explore the villa itself.

Hakusan, Ishikawa offers sublime ocean views and stunning mountain vistas. Once ruled by the wealthy Kaga clan, the area became a thriving center for Japanese fine arts, including ceramics and lacquerware in the 17th century, and it remains one of the country’s most important artistic hubs. Today, Japanese culture coexists with the modern art museum, the 21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art. For a taste of Japan as it once was, stroll through the historical center of Kanazawa or relax in the hot springs of Kaga Onsen.\n## How to Get There\nIshikawa is accessible by bullet train from Tokyo, and JR limited express trains from Osaka, Kyoto and Nagoya. Two airports serve the prefecture, Komatsu Airport and Noto Satoyama Airport. Highway buses are an alternative transit option from most major cities.\nTo reach Kanazawa, take the JR Hokuriku Shinkansen from Tokyo, or the JR Limited Express Thunderbird from Kyoto or Osaka. From Nagoya, take the JR Limited Express Shirasagi. Komatsu Airport, south of Kanazawa, is served by a host of domestic flights and a few international routes around Asia.

The unique undercoating produced only in Wajima gives this lacquerware its strength and durability, earning it a reputation as a top-quality traditional craft.\n- Kaga Yuzen Silk Dyeing\nKaga yuzen uses dyeing techniques that date back to the mid-15th century. Decorated in a pictorial realism style, common motifs include plants, flowers, birds and landscapes. This exquisite fabric is used for kimono, obi and fashion accessories.\n- Kutani Porcelain\nKutani yaki dates back to the 17th century, when porcelain clay was discovered locally.

There are 15 kaga vegetables, including lotus root, sweet potatoes, radishes and kinjiso (Okinawan spinach).\n- Jibu-ni\nNo one can quite agree on where the name for this stewed dish originates, but that doesn't mean it's not delicious. Thin slices of duck (or chicken) are tossed in starch, and cooked in a traditional Japanese soup. Once the meat is cooked and the soup thickens, mushrooms, bamboo shoots, wheat gluten and other ingredients are added before it's finished and served with a touch of grated wasabi. Try it throughout Ishikawa Prefecture.\n- Yamanaka Lacquerware\nThere are two types of lacquer in this region. The original technique has Yamanaka craftsmen using wood lathes to create objects with a distinctive wood grain clearly visible through applied lacquer, while the other involves maki-e, or decorating the objects with gold, silver, and shell in beautiful designs.\n- Hakusan Katatofu\nHakusan katatofu is rich in soybean flavor and contains less water than most tofu, which makes it much firmer.\n- Kanazawa Lacquerware\nKanazawa shikki evolved thanks to the patronage of feudal lords. The region's military heritage of lacquering military gear is credited for the local variety of maki-e, a style of painting using gold powder.\n## Seasonal Highlights\n- Spring\nView over 400 blossoming cherry trees in Kanazawa's Kenrokuen Garden and take in the spectacular Seihakusai Dekayama festival on the Noto Peninsula.\n- Summer\nEscape the heat with a hike in the Hakusan mountain range or enjoy the breezes along the coastline of the Noto Peninsula.

There are also gardens surrounding the museum.\n### Famous for winter snow crab\nThe port town of Hashitate, located just 10 minutes west of Katayamazu Onsen, is a leading fishing port where a vast array of seafood is offloaded. The incredibly fresh winter snow crab is particularly famous here.\n### Challenge yourself with a holy mountain climb\nMt Haku, or Hakusan, straddles the border between Ishikawa and Gifu in the southern part of Kaga. The hiking trails are officially open from July to October, and during the hot summer months, you will find local hikers escaping the heat on the peaks. With good weather, you can see panoramic views of the Japanese Alps and the Sea of Japan from the summit.\n### Road tripping\nRent a car and travel along the well-maintained Hakusan Shirakawago White Road. This scenic drive is spectacular in the fall, when the trees on the mountainside change to bright red, yellow, and orange hues. The winding road offers views of Mt Haku and of several waterfalls cascading down the mountainous terrain. There is also a hiking trail to a 1,736-meter peak.\n### Continuing the journey\nFor further exploration of the region, travel to nearby Fukui Prefecture, which is home to the Eiheiji Temple, one of the main temples of the Soto school of Zen Buddhism.

Often called the \"roof of Japan,\" it boasts the highest mountain ranges in the country. Enclaves of rural culture continue much as they have for centuries, with the villages of Tsumago and Narai appearing as if they were plucked straight from a samurai film. Raucous festivals and the stately black walls of Matsumoto Castle also survive intact, as do rustic onsen villages with their relaxing mountain ambiance. Karuizawa has a casual cosmopolitan atmosphere, with plenty of quirky pensions.\n## How to Get There\nThe Hokuriku Shinkansen from Tokyo is the easiest way to access northern Nagano.

It's rare to find true wasabi outside of Japan. Nagano wasabi is among the best, and eaten with many more dishes than just sushi.\n- Sake\nMuch like Niigata to the north, Nagano has built a reputation for brewing highly drinkable sake that can be delicate, complex and fruity. There are around 100 breweries taking advantage of the fine weather and water there, producing top brands such as Masumi and Iwashimizu.\n- Matsumoto Furniture\nLacquered furniture using traditional wood joinery has been made in Matsumoto for more than three centuries. Production was stopped before World War II, but was later revived through the Mingei folk craft movement.\n- Shinshu Pongee Silk\nShinshu tsumugi is made from a combination of raw, wild dupion and floss silk. Natural plant dyes and a subtle sheen give this warm fabric a luxurious quality. Used for kimono, the textile patterns include stripes, checks and splashes.\n- Matsumoto Thread Balls\nOnce popular as children’s toys, these bright and cheerful handmade temari balls from Matsumoto are now collected and displayed as interior decorations or given as gifts.

The accommodation tends to be more economical than Happo's, and it is popular with a younger crowd. Echoland is packed with bars, clubs, and pubs, making its nightlife especially renowned.\n### Bask in the grandeur of the Northern Alps\nThe mountains of Hakuba are part of the Northern Chubu-Sangaku National Park.

The views from the train give a tantalizing taste of what's in store.\nIf you're traveling from Tokyo, board a JR Azusa train at Shinjuku Station bound for Matsumoto and transfer to the Shinano Express in Shiojiri. Or take the Tokaido-Sanyo shinkansen from Tokyo Station, transferring in Nagoya.\nFrom northern Nagano, Kiso Fukushima is a straight shot on the Shinano Express from Nagano City or Matsumoto. Starting your trip at the post town of Magome in Gifu Prefecture is also an option, combined with a walk on the Nakasendo to Tsumago in Nagano.\n### Quick Facts\nThe Kiso Valley is bordered by the Central Alps to the east and Mt Ontake to the west\nThe wooden products you find for sale around Kiso are made from top quality hinoki cypress; prized by emperors, it will last for centuries\nThe Ontake faith is a blend of Shinto, esoteric Buddhism, and ancient shamanic practices\nAt 3,067 meters, Mt Ontake is Japan's second highest volcano after Mt Fuji\n### Hike the Nakasendo trail for a taste of old Japan\nFrom the early 1600s until the late 1800s, the Nakasendo Highway served as a vital travel artery, connecting Kyoto and Edo (now Tokyo). Seventy kilometers of it ran through Kiso; its 11 post towns, stretching from Magome in the south to Niekawa in the north, provided rest and entertainment for merchants and weary travelers.\n### Frozen in time\nPortions of Kiso's Nakasendo are still incredibly well preserved, like a vision drawn from one of Hiroshige's classic Ukiyoe prints. This is especially true of Magome and Tsumago, two iconic post towns with old wooden streetscapes at the southern entrance to the Kiso Valley.\nIn the northern part of the valley, the town of Narai is remarkably well preserved. It's larger than other towns in the area, with the main street stretching over a kilometer. It is best in the evening, when the old buildings are lit with glowing lanterns.\n### Explore Kiso Fukushima, the halfway point on the Nakasendo\nKiso's largest town is a relaxed community on the Kiso River. Formerly, it functioned as one of the checkpoints along the Nakasendo, used by the Tokugawa Shoguns in Edo to keep tight control over the movement of people, goods, and especially, guns. Today, Kiso Fukushima is a delightful town to wander around, with houses huddled above the Kiso River, several well-preserved neighborhoods, and souvenir shops.\n### Follow the pilgrim's way\nOne of Japan's most sacred mountains, Mt Ontake, has been a pilgrimage destination for over a thousand years. The faithful still come from all across Japan to walk the Ontake Pilgrimage Trail up to the summit, performing ceremonies at holy sites along the way.\n### Kiso's spectacular waterways\nThe Kiso Valley has a seemingly endless flow of incredibly pure water. Depending on lighting and other factors, its lakes, rivers, and streams vary from crystal clear to turquoise to emerald green.\nPlenty of water-based activities are available throughout Kiso. Go fishing in the hills and catch Japanese trout, known as iwana. Then, find the perfect cove for a barbeque beside the turquoise waters that flow through the Atera Ravine.\n### Kayak along Lake Ontake\nTo see more of the area, get out on the water and try kayaking on Lake Ontake for spectacular volcano views. Kayaking Lake Shizenko in Otaki Village will take you through a remote canyon towering above as you paddle along. Rafting on the Kiso River is another option for a day out on Kiso's waterways."}

Apart from being home to Japan's oldest extant castle, it is also the birthplace of avant-garde artist Yayoi Kusama. Hop on a bus decorated with polka dots in her honor to see the sights and explore the central Nagano region.\n### Don't Miss\n- Venturing inside the jet-black castle—aptly nicknamed Crow Castle\n- Bathing like a samurai in historical hot springs\n- The natural splendor of upland Kamikochi in the nearby mountains\n## How to Get There\nMatsumoto is the ideal hub for exploring the region and serves as a gateway to the Northen Japan Alps.\nEasily accessible by train from popular destinations such as Tokyo's Shinjuku Station (2 hours 40 minutes), Nagoya Station (2 hours), or nearby Nagano Station (50 minutes).\nConvenient bus service connects the area with Takayama in the neighboring Gifu Prefecture (2 hours 30 minutes).\n### Explore a national treasure\nBuilt in the late 16th century, Matsumoto Castle is among the oldest surviving castles in Japan. The striking five-tiered, six-story main tower, flanked on either side by smaller structures, is one of the most famous castles in Japan. As you travel through the original wooden interiors, past displays of medieval weaponry, stop to peer out through the narrow window and feel like one of the archers fighting in battles of old. Venturing to the top of the tower is well worth the reward, featuring a superb view of the city, as it stretches out to the Northern Alps.\nConsider timing your visit with one of the castle's seasonal events, such as Japanese taiko drumming and Noh theatre performances in the summer, a soba noodle event in the fall, and a glittering ice sculpture festival in the winter. The spring scenery is perhaps the most vibrant, with hundreds of cherry trees alongside the castle moat, bursting into bloom. Lively blossom viewing revelers flock to the banks, especially at night when the trees are illuminated.\n### Relax at Asama Onsen\nAfter a long day of exploring, rest your weary feet at Asama Onsen. You can choose from dozens of bathhouses, ranging from simple public baths to luxurious traditional inns providing the ultimate onsen experience, complete with fine Japanese cuisine.\nThe therapeutic pools of Asama Onsen were once restricted to the noble class, but now, everyone can take a dip. Of note is Biwa-no-Yu, which proudly boasts the title of being “The Rulers of Matsumoto Castle's Favorite Bath.” Soaking in Biwa-no-Yu's secluded wooden outdoor tub may give you an idea of why the old rulers of Matsumoto held these springs in such high regard.\n### An abundance of art and culture\nWandering through Matsumoto's many museums is a fantastic way to spend the day. If you enjoy classic Japanese prints, the Japan Ukiyo-e Museum houses over 100,000 pieces lovingly collected by a local merchant family over the centuries, which includes work by such masters as Katsushika Hokusai and Hiroshige Utagawa. The Matsumoto City Museum of Art has a more contemporary focus; it features Matsumoto native Yayoi Kusama's internationally-acclaimed dotted creations, as well as the work of several other Nagano artists.\nDrop by the Former Kaichi School—an old elementary school in Japan—for a look at late 19th century Western-inspired architecture and to see how students used to spend their days. If you're looking for a one-of-a-kind souvenir from your trip, the Agata no Mori Park hosts several craft fairs throughout the year.\n### Time for a drink\nIf you still have energy to spare for a night out on the town, look no further than the many dining and drinking spots that fill the streets between the station and the castle. Serious beer-lovers should head to the Matsumoto Brewery, where the taproom's tiny size belies the superior taste of its brews.\n### Bask in the beauty of Kamikochi\nNestled in the Northern Japan Alps, Kamikochi offers some of Japan's most splendid mountain scenery. The pure mountain air, stunning views, and blazing fall colors make it a must-visit for nature-lovers. With easy access to and from Matsumoto, it is a shared starting point for serious treks through the mountains, as well as relaxing day hikes along the crystal-clear Azusa River.\nThe central area around Kappabashi Bridge can get busy at times, but keep hiking along the Azusa River and you'll soon break away from the crowd. As you walk down the paths, keep your eyes peeled for a chance to see wild monkeys playing in the trees or roaming around.\n## Other Nearby Highlights\nDelving into a variety of wasabi-based cuisine at the impressive Daio Wasabi Farm\nHiking in summer and skiing in winter in the Hakuba area\nThe towering walls of the Tateyama Kurobe Alpine Route's snow corridor\nThe time-lost atmosphere of Narai at the eastern entrance to the Kiso Valley\n### Springtime sakura\nMatsumoto Castle is rightly famous for its prestigious cherry blossom viewing. For an equally picturesque picnic spot, take the train a short distance to Minami-Matsumoto Station. A leisurely stroll will take you to Koboyama Park, home to thousands of cherry trees that bloom over a two-week period amidst beautiful vistas of the Northern Japan Alps. If you have your heart set on seeing the blossoms at Matsumoto Castle, the evening light-up makes for the most striking pictures.\n### Summer festivals\nShould you find yourself in downtown Matsumoto in mid-August, you shouldn't miss Matsumoto Bon Bon music festival.

Stay in the city or take a short journey out of the center for world-class ski resorts, snow monkeys and other attractions that include a ninja park and a densely forested shrine.\n### Don't Miss\n- Chestnut sweets, local sake and Hokusai's wood block prints in charming Obuse\n## How to Get There\nFrom Tokyo, Nagano City is a straight 80-minute shot on the Hokuriku Shinkansen. From Osaka and Kyoto, take the bullet train to Nagoya and connect to JR's Wide View Shinano express service.\n### Quick Facts\nNagano is the prefecture's largest city with a population of about 375,000\nHost city of the 1998 Winter Olympics\n### Turn yourself into a ninja\nPractitioners of ninjutsu's shadow arts also called Togakushi home. You can delve into that history at the Togakure Ninja Museum, with antique weapon exhibits and a “ninja house” replete with trap doors and secret passageways. You can even try out your shuriken-throwing skills at their target range. Kids will enjoy the nearby Togakure Ninja Village theme park where they can don ninja outfits and slink their way through attractions like forested obstacle courses and a blow dart range.\nDon't forget to try Tokagushi's famous buckwheat soba noodles while in town. There are plenty of shops to choose from.\n### Get acquainted with Obuse\nCharming Obuse, about 20 kilometers northeast of Nagano, is one of the prefecture's most picturesque small towns. Streets in the center are laid with blocks of chestnut wood for slow strolls. Take time to drop into the refurbished townscape's many shops and cafes.\nObuse is famous for chestnuts, and its cafes offer amazing chestnut confectionaries and cakes. Local sake is also popular, with some brews still hand crafted in cedar barrels. Stop by Masuichi-Ichimura brewery or Matsubaya for samples.\n### Explore the Hokusaikan Museum\nAnother Obuse claim to fame was hosting the master woodblock artist Katsushika Hokusai for a time in the early 1800s. Its Hokusaikan Museum is a treasure trove of his work, including prints, scrolls and two intricately decorated portable shrines. Don't miss the ceiling he painted at Ganshoin Temple about a kilometer away.\n### Meet the fabled snow monkeys\nA little further down the train line from Obuse is Yudanaka, a small hot spring town from where you can catch a bus to visit the local hot spring-bathing monkeys. They are at their best in winter when Jigokudani—the valley that is their home—is covered in snow, but they are equally active and just as cute in any season.\nIf you plan to stay overnight in the area, choose from one of the many traditional hot spring hotels that line the main street running through Shibu Onsen.\n### More to do back in the city\nThe Nagano Prefectural Art Museum hosts the work of artists with ties to the prefecture; the attached Higashiyama Kaii Gallery has permanent and rotating exhibitions of Hokusai's work.\nZenkoji Temple, near Nagano Station, has a history of about 1,400 years and is the largest wooden structure in eastern Japan. The present main hall was built about 300 years ago. There are as many as 39 sub-temples on the grounds, called shukubo, that allow visitors to experience an overnight temple stay."}

From the narrow, store-lined streets to the thrilling winter fire festival, you don't have to be a skiier to have a great time here.\n### Don't Miss\n- Hitting the slopes at one of Japan's best ski destinations\n- Soothing aching muscles in a mineral-rich hot spring bath\n- Wandering the charming town that preserves the atmosphere of old Japan\n- Watching the hair-raising spectacle of Nozawa Onsen's fire festival\n## How to Get There\nNozawa Onsen is most conveniently accessed from Tokyo by car or bus.\nIf you are flying into Tokyo's Narita Airport or Haneda Airport, the Nagano Snow Shuttle conveniently offers a direct connection to Nozawa during the ski season of December to March. The journey takes approximately six hours. From Nozawa, the bus continues on to the other Nagano ski resorts of Hakuba and Shiga Kogen.\nAlternatively, you can take the Hokuriku Shinkansen from Tokyo Station to Iiyama (1 hour 40 minutes) and connect to the Nozawa Onsen Liner bus (25 minutes).\nDirect buses are available through the winter from Osaka, Kyoto and Nagoya.\n### Quick Facts\nLegend has it that a wandering Buddhist monk discovered Nozawa Onsen's many hot springs in the 8th century\nNozawa Onsen hosted the biathlon in the 1998 Winter Olympics, and many Japanese winter Olympians hail from here\n### A world of powder\nThe abundant powdery snow has put Nozawa Onsen on the radar of keen skiers and boarders around the world, turning it into one of Japan's most visited resorts. Skiing was introduced here in 1912, one of the first places in the country to take up the sport. In the past, the area has experienced snowfalls of up to 10 meters. You can find 19 lifts that whisk you up to 44 trails spread over 50 kilometers of slopes, suitable for skiers and snowboarders of all levels.\nThe Japan Ski Museum, just north of the village, is packed with winter sports artifacts. Exhibits cover the Olympics, the history of skiing in Japan and more.\n### Soak the body and the spirit\nNothing beats a soak in a hot spring after a long day on the slopes. Nozawa Onsen's neighborhood associations maintain 13 free public onsen throughout the village, each dedicated to a different bodhisattva, or Buddhist deity. Oyu occupies an intricate wooden building in the village center and is the largest. You might want to enter the tub gingerly; Nozawa's baths are extremely hot.\nThe natural spring water is also refreshing and delicious, and you can fill up water bottles from Hachiman Shrine or near the Nagasaka gondola station.\n### Monkey see, monkey bathe\nYou can combine your stay in Nozawa with a visit to the famous snow monkeys of Jigokudani Snow Monkey Park, with a direct bus departing twice daily during the winter season, from December to April. The trip takes about one hour.\n### Fiery thrills\nNozawa Fire Festival is one of the wildest traditional Shinto festivals in Japan and is a spectacle not to miss.\nThe festival takes place yearly on January 15, combining a rite of passage to protect village men in their so-called unlucky years (as dictated by the traditional calendar) with ancient New Year fire rituals. Villagers with beacons of bundled reeds attempt to torch a makeshift shrine in a standoff with the men trying to protect the shrine. With sparks flying in all directions, this battle over the shrine is electrifying.\n### Apres ski evenings in Nozawa\nWhile Nozawa's nightlife may be lower key than that of resorts like Hakuba, you can still find plenty to do after dark. Izakaya, Japanese-style pubs and buckwheat noodle shops abound. Libushi has a variety of Japanese craft beers on tap, while Kaze no Ie serves delicious Italian fare and the bubbly proprietor will welcome you. The homey coffee shop Shichirohei offers meals as well, and is popular with locals.\nFor something lighter, pick up some oyaki, grilled dumplings with savory fillings like winter squash and spicy eggplant. They are available from roadside vendors, as are onsen-boiled eggs. Near the main bath house, Oyu, is an open square called Ogama, where the locals cook eggs in the spring water, which maintains a constant temperature of 90℃. Wake up early in the morning to see them hard at work.\n### The perfect summer mountain retreat\nWhile winter is the peak season for tourism in Nozawa Onsen, the town offers a cool retreat from the oppressive heat of the lowlands during the summer months. You can rent mountain bikes, hike and kayak in the area, and local businesses offer yoga classes, Japanese cooking classes, art retreats and much more.\nIt is worth stopping by the charming town of Obuse, where woodblock print artist Hokusai spent his later years. If you take the Shinkansen bullet train to Nagano City, take the time to visit the impressive Zenkoji Temple and dine on local soba noodles before heading up to Nozawa Onsen."}

It's less than a three-hour train ride from Tokyo on the JR Chuo Line-Limited Express from Shinjuku Station.\nFor those heading straight to the Kamikochi area, there are a number of direct night buses that run from Tokyo, Osaka, and Kyoto.\nIf you're already in the area, take the Matsumoto Denkitetsudo train from Nagano's Matsumoto city to Shin-Shimashima Station, then a bus to Kamikochi. This takes around two hours. Private cars aren't permitted in the Kamikochi area.\n### The stunning Northern Alps\nWith world-class snow sports facilities and easy access from the lowlands and peaks reaching over 3,000 meters, the Northern Alps range is one of Japan's most famous alpine areas.\n### Nonstop adventure for wilderness fans\nLocated within Chubu Sangaku National Park, there's always plenty to see and do year-round.

Yarigatake, or going deep with a multi-day trek to the pristine alpine plateau of Kumo-no-Daira, you'll never be short of options for outdoor adventures.\n### Visit historic Matsumoto Castle\nThe area around the Northern Alps has plenty to offer as well. A visit to Matsumoto Castle located in the neighboring area is the perfect place to spend some time en-route to the heights.\n### The ultimate snow-lover's getaway\nThe world-famous winter resort of Hakuba offers stellar powder, around ten runs, and beautiful scenery even during the off-season, with year-round accommodation.\n### The Central Alps\nAlso known as the Kiso Alps, the Central Alps form the spine of southern Nagano, with the Ina Valley spreading to the east and the Kiso Valley running along the west.\n### Take the ropeway to an alpine wilderness\nMt. Hoken and Mt. Komagatake are the peaks most easily reached thanks to the Central Alps Komagatake Ropeway on the eastern side of the range. The ropeway whisks you 2,600 meters up, unveiling a world of gorgeous alpine scenery and rare plants at the Senjojiki Cirque, carved by glaciers 20,000 years ago.\n### Alpine adventures in the Southern Alps\nWhile less accessible than the Northern or Central Alps, the Southern Alps area is a fantastic base for alpine adventures. Many of its peaks lie within the Minami Alps National Park, and the entire area, including the communities at the foot of the range, has been declared a Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO.\n### Trekking the southern pocket\nYou can trek the Southern Alps from Nagano, but the climbs are tougher and less accessible than from the other side in Yamanashi. The area along the foot of the range in Nagano's Ina Valley is well worth a visit.\n### Visit Oshika for cultural festivities\nOshika Village's free kabuki festivals in the spring and fall draw impressive crowds, as does Takato Castle Park's renowned cherry blossom festival in the spring. Iida's August puppet festival features performers from across Japan, and its puppet museum showcases 300 years of the fascinating traditional style of Bunraku puppetry."}

From Tokyo Station, take the Hokuriku Shinkansen toward Kanazawa and get off at Joetsumyoko Station. The train ride takes roughly three hours. From Niigata Station, take the Joetsu Shinkansen toward Tokyo and transfer to the Shirayuki Limited Express at Nagaoka. The ride takes about two hours.\nDriving is the easiest way to get around since some spots are quite remote. The drive from Tokyo takes four hours on the Kanetsu and Joshinetsu expressways. From Niigata, it takes about two hours on the Hokuriku Expressway.\n### Outdoor adventures\nMt. Myoko is a 2,454-meter active volcano listed as one of Japan's 100 Famous Mountains. It is a popular hiking spot. Be ready to start hiking at dawn since the hike, which can be steep and rocky, takes around four hours each way. In the winter, hiking is considered too dangerous since the top of the mountain is prone to avalanches.\nLocated at the foot of Mt. Myoko is Tsubame Onsen, which receives a ready supply of hot spring water from the mountain. Although the area is host to several ryokan, Tsubame Onsen has a secluded milky-white bath that is completely outdoors. There is no entrance fee, but a donation is customary here. The spot gets quite crowded on the weekend because the bath is only big enough for five to six people.\nSeki, Akakura, Ikenotaira, and Suginosawa are other popular hot spring villages in the area.\n### Powder snow heaven\nNiigata is known as snow country, and Myoko is right in the heart of Niigata, making it the ideal place for snow lovers. The snow in Myoko is dry, powdery, and fluffy, perfect for skiing and snowboarding. There are nine skiing grounds in the area, and famous slopes include Akakura, Akakura Kanko, Suginohara, and Ikenotaira on the slopes of Mt. Myoko's foothills.\n### The colors and tastes of the seasons\nMyoko is gorgeous in all seasons. To the south of the ski resorts lies Naena Falls, a perfect spot for cooling down in the summer and viewing a colorful tapestry in the fall. On the way there, stop by the local somen noodle shops, where you grab the noodles as they flow past you in a stream of water contained in a half bamboo. The trick is to catch them with your chopsticks. Another beautiful spot is Imori Pond, which draws keen photographers. The pond's mirror-like water reflects Mt. Myoko and the vivid colors of the trees."}

The port town is a major transportation hub, easily accessible by air, sea and rail.\n### Don't Miss\n- Drinking top-quality sake to your heart's content at Niigata's restaurants and izakaya\n- Viewing cherry blossoms in Hakusan Park\n- Learning about the marine life of the Sea of Japan at Marinepia Nihonkai Aquarium\n- Taking a ferry to Sado Island\n## How to Get There\nNorth of Tokyo, Niigata is easily accessible by bullet train.\nFrom Tokyo Station, take the Joetsu Shinkansen to Niigata Station. The ride takes about two hours. You can also get there by express bus from Ikebukuro or Shinjuku in Tokyo. The journey takes about four or five hours. There are also flights and buses to Niigata from other major cities.\n### The center of old and new\nThe Shinano River runs through the centre of Niigata. The six-arch Bandai Bridge, a symbol of the city and a designated national cultural asset, spans the centre of the city.\nNear Bandai Bridge is Bandai City Rainbow Tower, with an observation deck at 100 meters. Food enthusiasts can take in the view of the revolving restaurant on the same floor.\nBandai Bridge and Rainbow Tower form part of Bandai City, the new part of Niigata City that provides a host of entertainment. In Bandai City, you'll find shops, movie theaters, and restaurants clustered together.\n### Niigata and the sea\nLife in Niigata City is closely tied to its coastal location on the Sea of Japan.

When gold was discovered on Sado at the turn of the 17th century, the sleepy island's fate changed forever.\nThese days Sado is a great little island retreat best known for its association with Kodo, the dynamic drumming group, and for the Earth Celebration, a yearly event focusing on drumming, humanity, nature, and Japanese culture. Sado's onsen (hot spring) is another attraction, as is the award-winning sake produced from the rice grown on the island. The rice is produced using sustainable and environmentally friendly farming methods to protect the population of Japanese crested ibis (Toki). Cycling, camping, and water sports are popular, and you can even pan for gold here.\n### Don't Miss\n- The area's famous dish: deep-fried amberjack (buri katsudon）\n- Gold panning in Nishimikawa Gold Park\n- Driving down the Osado Skyline route\n## How to Get There\nSado Island can only be reached by ferry.\nYou can take the Sado Kisen ferry from two locations, but some ferries do not operate all year round. The Niigata-Ryotsu route offers a passenger jetfoil and car ferry. The jetfoil is faster but more expensive, while the car ferry takes over twice as long but is less than half the price. This is the most popular option.\nThe Naoetsu-Ogi jetfoil service runs during peak seasons, excluding winter. The service runs twice a day and is convenient for access from the Kansai and Chubu regions. The number of services on the different routes varies according to season, so please check the timetable on the Sado Kisen website.\n### Quick Facts\nPolitical and intellectual enemies like Zeami and Nichiren were banished here until the 1700s\nThe island is home to the world-renowned taiko ensemble Kodo\nSado is famous for its endangered Japanese crested ibis\n### A lesser-known island getaway\nSado has picturesque beaches, cascading rice paddies, and winding mountain roads. There's great hiking and swimming to be enjoyed. Best navigated by driving the scenic routes around the island, Sado shows a rugged side of Japan that many never see.\nAlthough it's possible to travel to and from Sado in a day, a night at one of the many traditional ryokan inns is rewarding. Stay and relax in a hot spring bath and enjoy home-cooked meals featuring Niigata's famous rice.\n### The art of rice\nNiigata is known throughout Japan for its singularly delicious rice and beautifully tiered rice paddies, and Sado is no exception with its iconic Iwakubi Shoryu rice paddies and sustainable, environmentally friendly production.\nAnywhere you go on the island will serve Niigata rice and sake, especially if you stay in a traditional ryokan inn. If you'd like to sample the island's award-winning sake at the source, pay a visit to the Hokusetsu Brewery, where you can savor your sake in a music room designed to gently mellow the brew.\n### Travel the seas in a washtub\nSado Island is famous for its clear sea waters and rocky shores, and one of the most interesting ways to experience them is in a tarai bune which is a wooden tub-turned boat. Originally made from large barrels to store products such as miso paste, the agile tarai bune can reach narrow spots along the rocky coast, making them ideal for gathering bounty such as seaweed, turban shells and abalone. On the southern tip of the island in the town of Ogi, you can take a short ride in one of these traditional boats, steered by a local dressed in an authentic period costume.\n### Celebrate the earth\nThe most significant event on Sado Island is the annual Earth Celebration Festival in August, drawing huge crowds to the small town of Ogi every year. The Kodo Taiko Ensemble, locals from the island who are famous worldwide for their ground-shaking take on traditional Japanese drumming, started and run this festival.\nThe Kodo group pushes the limits at each performance. The festival is dedicated to global unity, and musicians from around the world are invited to collaborate with the Kodo Taiko Ensemble. If you're looking for a unique Japanese music festival, this is the one to visit.\n### Drum up some fun\nExperience traditional culture firsthand by taking a taiko drumming experience session at the Sado Island Taiko Center, home to giant drums made from zelkova logs and cowhide. The Taiko Center is located just one minute from Kodo Village, where the world-renowned taiko ensemble is based. You can watch the professionals play and learn to create some thunder yourself.\n### One for the birds\nSado Island is home to fantastic rare fauna. It preserves an important ecological habitat for the toki, or Japanese crested ibis. These birds nearly became extinct as their feathers were used in Japanese futons, but recent rehabilitation efforts are seeing results, and the population is increasing. Environmentally friendly farming methods are used on the island to sustain the prey that the toki feed on.\nThere are some now living in the wild on Sado Island, but your best chance to admire and learn more about the ibis is at Toki Forest Park.\n### Turtle beach\nAt the northern tip of the island is Futatsugame, a sandy beach with an offshore islet said to resemble two turtles. Relax here for an afternoon in the clearest waters in Sado, one of Japan's Top 100 Sea-Bathing Spots. There's also a beautiful hiking trail that takes you up into the cliffs for some gorgeous sea views.\n### Scenic drives\nDriving is the best way to see all Sado has to offer, and taking a spin around the Osado Skyline is a must. The winding mountain road provides panoramas of the entire island and out to sea, and will eventually bring you to the Sado Gold Mine.\n### Panning for gold\nSado Gold Mine and Nishimikawa Gold Park are located on the island's western coast. You can try gold panning for yourself and learn more about Sado's gold mining past, which is what drew the attention of the shogun to the island which came under his direct control.\n### Island heritage\nKomponji Temple and Myoshoki Temple were local temples home to the famous Buddhist reformer Nichiren (1222-1282), who was exiled to Sado for two years. He created his own school of Buddhism. Myoshoji is known for its beautiful garden.\nShukunegi is a small atmospheric old port town that is perfect for a stroll through a preserved townscape."}

When the snow begins to melt, the Tateyama Mountain Range and local gorges draw nature lovers and outdoor enthusiasts for scenic hikes, mountain exploration, and casual hot spring getaways. Seasonal seafood, such as firefly squid in spring, is another regional draw. While in the area, keep your eye out for glassware, bronzeware, wood carvings and other traditional crafts with centuries-long histories.\n## How to Get There\nReach Toyama by bullet train from Kanazawa, Nagano, Tokyo and other stations on the Hokuriku Shinkansen line. Express buses also connect Toyama with Matsumoto City and other transport hubs.\nFrom Tokyo, the bullet train takes two and a half hours. From Osaka and Kyoto, take the JR Thunderbird Limited Express to Kanazawa, after which it is a 20-minute ride on the JR Hokuriku Shinkansen to Toyama Station. Highway buses run from Nagoya (three hours) and Nohi express buses connect Matsumoto City in Nagano Prefecture with Toyama City.\n### Don’t Miss\n- The World Heritage villages of Suganuma and Ainokura, collectively known as Gokayama\n- Kurobe Dam, an impressive feat of engineering and Japan's tallest dam\n- The enormous towering snow walls of the alpine route's snow corridor, open in spring\n- Trekking the Tateyama Mountains and visiting a volcanic crater lake\n## Explore Toyama by Area\n- \\\\\nGokayama\n- \\\\\nTateyama & Kurobe\n- \\\\\nToyama City\n- \\\\\nTakaoka\n## Trending Attractions in Toyama\n- Tateyama Snow CorridorTateyama Snow Corridor\\\\\nTateyama Kurobe Alpine Route (Toyama)\n- toyama & around\\\\\nKurobe Gorge\n- Takaokakojo Park\\\\\nTakaoka Kojo Park\n- Tonami Tulip Park\\\\\nTonami Tulip Park\n- Kurobe Dam\\\\\nKurobe Dam\n## Local Specialties\n- Hotaruika\nKnown in English as firefly squid due to the bluish light they emit, hotaruika are found and fished in the waters off Toyama Prefecture between April and June. Try some marinated in soy sauce or topped with vinegared miso. You can also savor them fresh and without cooking as sashimi, or dried and roasted—an excellent accompaniment to the local sake.\n- Takaoka Lacquerware\nWith a history dating back over 400 years, Takaoka shikki lacquerware has several distinctive variations. Aogai involves using thin slices of shell to create geometric images of birds and flowers; Yusuke incorporates shell, gold, and stones; and Chokoku involves carving designs prior to lacquering. All result in beautiful, original works.\n- Toyama Hoshigaki\nToyama persimmons are some of Japan's sweetest. When they've been hung up outside and air dried, they become even sweeter and are known as hoshigaki.\n- Shiro Ebi\nA rare species that makes its home in Toyama Bay, shiro ebi or white shrimp are famous for their delicate flavor and refined sweetness. They are delicious as sashimi or sushi, or topping a fresh bowl of rice.\n## Seasonal Highlights\n- Spring\nWhile most of Japan goes crazy with cherry blossom fever in April, visitors flock to Toyama to see the 20-meter tall snow walls in the Tateyama Mountains—a lingering testament to the severity of winter in the Japan Alps.\n- Summer\nCool down with refreshing breezes—or lingering snow—in the Tateyama Mountains. Visit Kurobe Dam or hang out on the coast at Kaiwomaru Park, home to an impressive 29-sail galley from a bygone era.\n- Autumn\nTemperatures cool off quickly in Toyama, which gives the October fall foliage an especially pronounced hue. The thatched-roof houses in Gokayama are just waiting to be photographed. For invigorating fall hikes, head to Kurobe Gorge.\n- Winter\nWinter is severe in Toyama with Siberian winds and blankets of snow. Copy the locals and ski, snowboard or enjoy scenic snowscapes—particularly pleasurable from a steaming outdoor hot spring."}

From Shin-Takaoka Station, take the World Heritage Bus for a one-hour direct trip to Gokayama. From Takaoka Station, take the Johama Train Line to Johana Station (50 minutes) and catch a 25-minute bus to Gokayama.\n### A glimpse of old Japan\nWith their carefully preserved gassho-zukuri buildings, Gokayama is full of charm and simplicity. In summer, they offer a relaxing retreat from the big city bustle in lush nature, while in winter the snowy rooftops create scenes of rustic beauty.\n### Say a little prayer\nAinokura and Suganuma are the modern names of the historical villages Taira and Kamitaira. Their famed “praying hands” buildings—so named for the thatched roofs resembling hands joined in prayer—range in age from one hundred to four hundred years old.\nThese days, you can only see gassho-style villages in Toyama and neighboring Gifu Prefecture. Gifu is home to the UNESCO-listed Shirakawa-go. Ainokura and Suganuma present rare and precious opportunities to experience a different side of Japanese culture.\n### Nature intertwined with culture\nThe appeal of Gokayama centers on the area's seamless blend of nature and culture. Unlike many other UNESCO sites in Japan, the traditional buildings here don't have to compete with modern urban environments. Instead, their rural setting preserves the natural harmony between the countryside and grass-thatched structures that almost seem to have sprouted from the earth.\nThe setting evokes a simpler time preserved in the sturdy buildings and peaceful walks of Gokayama now all but vanished into the cultural memory of Japan.\n### Don't judge a gassho-zukuri by its cover\nAppreciating gassho-zukuri goes beyond admiring their external appearance. Some of the gassho-zukkuri houses have been converted into quaint eating establishments and lodgings, reflecting their historical role as traditional minka dwellings. Consider staying a night in Gokayama to immerse yourself in the ancient charm.\nWhile walking the streets may be akin to exploring an open-air museum, staying at a traditional minka and sampling local delicacies within their walls further enhances the old-world experience.\n### Feel the warmth\nEven if you don't stay in a gassho-zukkuri house, you can see inside one at the exhibition hall. When seen from within, the gassho-zukuri structures reveal a range of clever subtleties, such as the open lofts that served as spaces for silkworm cultivation. More than that, there is a palpable feeling of warmth to the old wood interiors that is best experienced firsthand.\n### When to Go\nThe Ainokura Gassho-zukuri village is open 7 days a week from 8:30 am to 5 pm.\nThe Suganuma Gassho-zukuri village is open from 8 am to 5 pm and closed for the year-end and New Year holidays.\nThe villages of Ainokura and Suganuma hold occasional light up events during the year."}

Boasting such highlights as Zuiryuji Temple, the abundant green space of Takaoka Castle Park, and one of Japan's three Great Buddha statues, the city attracts visitors year-round. You may arrive thinking it's a wonderful place for a day trip and leave thinking it would be the perfect place to live.\n### Don't Miss\n- Zuiryuji Temple, a 17th century Zen Temple celebrated for its elegance and symmetry\n- Takaoka Castle Park, expansive and beautifully maintained, is especially magical during cherry blossom season\n- The Daibutsu—the newest of the three Great Buddha statues in Japan\n## How to Get There\nTakaoka is right on the Horkuriku Shinkansen Line and easy to access, especially for Japan Rail Pass holders.\nThe Kagayaki and Hakutaka trains on the Hokuriku Line can take you from Tokyo to Takaoka in just under three hours.\nTakaoka fits easily into a tour of the western side of Japan that includes destinations such as Kanazawa, Takayama and Matsumoto.\n### Fill your culture quota\nWhether you're interested in history, art, or eastern religion, there are several destinations around the city center from which to choose.\nZuiryuji Temple offers a grand example of Zen temple design. The Great Buddha is imposing in scale and beautifully cast, while Takaoka Castle Park provides picturesque lawns and gardens.\nA little farther away, the historic district presents a more subdued image of daily life in the Edo period.\n### Compact and easy to navigate\nThe central location of Takaoka's main attractions make it easy to tour the city on foot. On clear days, enjoy a leisurely stroll through the open and calm streets. Alternatively, the Manyo Line can zip you around town. As a fully operational trolley line, it's a rarity in modern Japan, where most electric streetcars have been scrapped for buses.\n### Local culture and history\nThe Manyo Line takes its name from a popular collection of tanka poetry by the famous poet Otomo no Yakamochi (718-785), who is thought to have lived in the area.\nManga fans will notice that some of the line's trolley cars are painted to resemble Doraemon, a beloved character created by Takaoka's own Fujiko F. Fujio. There's also a Doraemon walkway with statues of characters from the manga.\nKeen-eyed visitors will notice the figure of Maeda Toshinaga in statues and other images around town. This one-time military leader would turn to more spiritual reflections later in life, ordering the construction of Zuiryuji Temple in 1608.\n### A gentler city experience\nSome cities just exude class. Like its cross-prefecture neighbors of Kanazawa, Takayama and Matsumoto, Takaoka eschews city sprawl for a more restrained take on modern life. 21st-century buildings blend seamlessly with traditional architecture and age-old culture. Nature surrounds the city, with the Japan Sea to the west and the holy mountain of Tateyama looming on the eastern horizon.\n### Treasures of the coast\nNeed a reason to base yourself in Takaoka for a few days? Nearby Tonami stages a grand tulip festival from April 21 to May 5 every year, and the sight of 2.5 million tulips is one you won't soon forget. Also in the area, Himi offers hot spring bathing and sublime coastal views.\n### An excellent fit for your itinerary\nThose seeking an alternative to Japan's popular \"Golden Route\" are increasingly turning to less tourist-saturated spots on the west coast. Anyone traveling through Kanazawa, Shirakawa-go, or Kamikochi, should consider a trip to Takaoka as well.\n### When to go\nTakaoka is worth visiting year-round, but some events take place over short periods:\nThe Sakura Festival at Takaoka Castle Park is held from April 1 to 15\nThe Tonami Tulip Festival lasts from April 21 to May 5\nZuiryuji Temple holds an illumination event on evenings from April 28 to 30"}

Viewed from the flatlands along the coast, they tower imposingly at close to 3,000 meters.\nIf you want to experience the mountains in a more hands-on fashion, there are two popular ways to get to higher ground: the Tateyama Kurobe Alpine Route and the Kurobe Gorge Railway.\n### Don't Miss\n- Spectacular stargazing and mountain views from Murodo, the highest point of the Tateyama Kurobe Alpine Route\n- Ride the trolley through the densely wooded mountain passes of Kurobe Gorge\n- Hot spring bathing, hiking courses, and observation points dotting the gorge\n- The immense snow corridor in early spring with snow walls up to 20 meters high on the Tateyama Kurobe Alpine Route\n## How to Get There\nNote that the Tateyama Kurobe Alpine Route and Kurobe Gorge are two entirely different locations accessed from different points. Both take time and effort to reach but are well worth the effort.\nAccess to Kurobe Gorge is via Unazuki Onsen Station, not to be confused with the similarly named Kurobe Unazuki Onsen Station on the Hokuriku Shinkansen Line. If arriving from outside the prefecture via bullet train, take the Toyama Chiho Railway from the shinkansen station to Unazuki Onsen Station. Kurobe Gorge Railway operates trolleys through the gorge from Unazuki to Keyakidaira, the terminus.\nThe starting point of the Tateyama Kurobe Alpine Route is Tateyama Station if approaching from Toyama and Ogizawa Station if beginning your journey in neighboring Nagano Prefecture. From Toyama take the Toyama Chiho Railway Line from Dentetsu Toyama Station. From Nagano Prefecture, access Ogizawa Station by express bus from Nagano Station or local bus from Shinano Omachi Station on the JR Oito Line.\n### The many faces of Kurobe\nBefore you set out to explore either destination, you should understand the differences between the various locations bearing the name Kurobe or Tateyama.\nThe name Kurobe appears throughout Toyama Prefecture geography in the names of a major dam, a river, and numerous mountains. For simplicity's sake, we should distinguish between the following:\nKurobe City: a municipality in Toyama that includes Unazuki, the starting point of Kurobe Gorge\nKurobe Gorge: a scenic route stretching from Unazuki to Keyakidaira and traversed by the historic Kurobe Gorge Railway Line\nTateyama Kurobe Alpine Route: a different route beginning in Tateyama City, extending across the Northern Japan Alps and terminating in Omachi City, Nagano Prefecture\n### The many faces of Tateyama\nThe name Tateyama belongs to the following:\nTateyama Town: small town whose train station marks the start of the Tateyama Kurobe Alpine Route\nTateyama Kurobe Alpine Route—as described above\nMt. Tateyama: 3,000-meter high mountains centered on Mt. Oyama, located in the southeastern part of Toyama Prefecture and in the northwestern part of the Hida Mountains\nThe major attractions in the Tateyama Kurobe area are all closed for winter and each operates on a slightly different schedule. Be sure to check with a tourist information office when planning your trip.\n### The best time to go\nPopular times to visit include October and November, when autumn foliage brightens Toyama's mountainsides.\nThe Tateyama Kurobe Alpine Route's snow corridor opens in April when the snow walls are at their highest. If you can't make it in April, the snow usually remains until early June."}

The sea serves up a bounty of fresh fish, while the famous peaks of Tateyama and Tsurugi invite alpine excursions. Centrally located, the city is a convenient hub for exploring the surrounding areas.\n### Don't Miss\n- The dramatic Toyama Glass Art Museum, constructed to look like shards of glass\n- A spring cruise through the cherry blossom tunnel, along the Matsukawa river\n- Learning about local crafts and culture at The Toyama Municipal Folkcraft Village\n## How to Get There\nToyama is easily accessible from Tokyo and other major cities.\nTake the Hokuriku Shinkansen from Tokyo Station. The ride takes approximately two hours and is covered by the Japan Rail Pass. Alternatively, a highway bus connects Toyama City and Tokyo and takes seven hours. Some companies also offer night bus services.\n### The taste of the city\nToyama is a modern city, but it retains the local character shaped by its surroundings—mountains, sea, and rivers. Restaurants offer local specialties like Kurobe Ramen, with its distinctively rich, black broth soy sauce, along with some of the freshest seafood in Japan, including trout sushi wrapped in fresh bamboo leaves.\n### The art of glass\nToyama is home to the most substantial number of active glassworkers in Japan, so naturally, it has an excellent museum dedicated to the craft. Conveniently located in Central Toyama, the Toyama Glass Art Museum cuts a distinctive figure in the urban landscape. The Kuma Kengo-designed building is a work of art in itself and a great advertisement for what lies within its walls.\nThe basic entrance fee grants you access to the permanent collection on the fourth and sixth floors of the building. This includes the visually stunning Glass Art Garden with installations by Dale Chihuly that are a definite highlight.\nOther museums worth visiting include the Toyama Prefectural Museum of Art and Design, which is another stunning modern edifice, perched on the edge of the river, with sweeping city views from the rooftop. The Toyama Museum of Modern Art features some of the big names of Western art, including Picasso and Warhol along with prominent Japanese and local artists.\n### A wealth of side trips\nToyama is well-placed for day trips to nearby sites and attractions. Takaoka is home to a famous temple and one of Japan's Three Great Buddhas, while the Amaharashi Coast offers breathtaking views of the sea. Intrepid travelers can also attempt a round trip visit to the Tateyama Kurobe Alpine Route (Toyama). And a little further afield, the UNESCO certified Gokayama District provides a look at rustic gassho-zukuri (praying hands) architecture.\n### Japan's great northwestern hub\nToyama's location and access to public transportation make it a great starting point for trips in and around the region. Take day trips to nearby towns and ski resorts, tackle the Tateyama Kurobe Alpine Route and continue on to Nagano Prefecture or visit neighboring prefectures such as Kanazawa, Takayama, Kamikochi, and Matsumoto."}

Today, both towns are perfectly preserved \"open-air museums”.\n### Don't Miss\n- Exploring the cobbled streets of Magome-juku\n- A museum dedicated to local novelist Toson Shimazaki\n- Overlooking the Nakasendo from the top of the hill\n## How to Get There\nAccess to Magome-juku is most convenient from JR Nagoya Station.\nFrom Nagoya take the Shinano Express on the JR Chuo Main Line to JR Nakatsugawa. From there, a regular bus goes to Magome-juku, which in turn is connected to Tsumago-juku by bus. Alternatively, you can take a regular train at JR Nakatsugawa that goes to JR Nagiso Station. Buses at JR Nagiso go to both Tsumago and Magome.\nFor the adventurous, the walk between Magome-juku and Tsumago-juku is between 2 and 2.5 hours.\n### Best-kept secret\nThe Nakasendo was the northern, mountain road between Tokyo and Kyoto. There were 69 post towns which served as overnight stopping points for travelers, providing lodging, food, and entertainment.\nOnce ignored by guidebooks and considered too far off the beaten track, it has been perfectly recreated as an authentic Edo period (1603-1867) town to give visitors a glimpse into pre-modern Japan.\n### A photographer's paradise\nA bus from Nakatsugawa Station drops you at the beginning of the cobbled road that winds uphill through the town. From seasonal flowers through street-side waterways to enormous working waterwheels, photo opportunities abound.\n### Local crafts and culture\nPlenty of shops sell local products from ceramics to sake and you will also find many cafes and noodle shops. Across from the Tourist Information office is a museum dedicated to local novelist Toson Shimazaki (English signage is minimal). Some of his books are available in translation.\n### The past and present merge\nMagome-juku is still a living, functioning post town. Each house is a real residence, conveying the look and feel of the area and atmosphere of the time, helping to evoke its lively 400-year history.\nIt also means you need to be aware when exploring and photographing that private residences aren't exhibits. There are signs marking which buildings are open to the public and which are private.\n### Be our guest\nThere is a guesthouse midway between Nakatsugawa and Magome-juku, so if you are on a more relaxed schedule, it is a treat to see the town devoid of visitors as the sun sets and rises behind the dramatic peaks.\nThe best place from which to observe the area is the viewpoint at the top of the hill as you leave town. From here, the Nakasendo twists through forests and rice fields, passing powerful waterfalls, beautifully preserved farmhouses and waterwheels.\n## Keywords"}

It does not affiliate with any Buddhist sect and accepts all without distinction. It also enshrines what is believed to be one of the oldest Buddhist statues in Japan––the statue of Ikko Sanzon Amida Nyorai(Amida Triad Sharing One Halo), the Buddha of immeasurable light and life. The statue of Ikko Sanzon Amida Nyorai, also known as Zenkoji Nyorai was first brought to Japan from the Korean Peninsula in 552 and, while it cannot be viewed first-hand, remains a symbol of openness and acceptance.\n### Don't Miss\n- View the temple grounds and Nagano city from the second floor of the Sanmon Gate\n- Tour around the Buddhist altar and down a mysterious corridor to the “key of enlightenment”\n- Meander through the giftshops and restaurants that line the path to the temple entrance\n## How to Get There\nZenkoji Temple is accessible by the Hokuriku Shinkansen (bullet train), taking 1.5 hours from Tokyo to Nagano Station. The temple is 1.8 kilometers from the station and can be reached in 30 minutes by foot or 15 minutes by bus.\n### Quick Facts\nZenkoji Temple is highly esteemed as an essential destination for any pilgrim, regardless of the distance\nThe 1.8-kilometer stretch from Nagano Station to Zenkoji Temple is lined with stores and restaurants\nZenkoji Temple has 39 temple lodgings\n### A Buddhist image kept so secret, even the head priest is not permitted to see it\nThe Ikko Sanzon Amida Nyorai, also known as the Zenkoji Nyorai, is the central object of veneration at Zenkoji Temple. The statue of Ikko Sanzon Amida Nyorai in the center of a single halo with Kannon (left side) and Seishi (right side) has remained shrouded in secrecy, concealed from all eyes since 654. During the Kamakura period (1185-1333), however, a second statue was sculpted in the image of the Ikko Sanzon Amida Nyorai to serve as an embodiment and figure of worship for the people. This statue, known as the “Maedachi Honzon” is publicly displayed in the main hall once every seventh year during the dedicated “Gokaicho” (revealing) ceremony. The statue is connected to the towering “Ekohashira” pillar in front of the temple by the rope, which, according to belief, will connect anyone who touches it to the “Maedachi Honzon” and bring good fortune.\n### A diversity of interactive experiences\nNowadays visitors can partake in activities and experience the history and culture of Zenkoji Temple, which dates to 642 when the statue of Amida Nyorai was brought from Baekje, one of the three ancient kingdoms of the Korean Peninsula, in 552 and enshrined at the temple.\nThe majestic Sanmon gates, first built in 1750, underwent large-scale renovations and now seconds as an observation area that offers sweeping views of the temple grounds and main hall. Try taking off your shoes and climbing the stairs to the second floor; it's worth the effort.\nAs you approach the main hall, you'll find the Binzuru sonja statue, also called \"Nade-botoke\" (patting Buddha) sitting in the entrance. Try patting its head to ease any weariness and receive its healing powers.\nSo many visitors have rubbed its head since 1713 that its face has been worn down to the point of being unrecognizable.\nAt the far end of the main hall is the entrance for the tour around the Buddhist altar. Here you will find a dark corridor that leads to the basement of the main hall. Legend has it that if you follow the corridor and touch the \"key of enlightenment,\" you will connect with the hidden Zenkoji Nyorai who is seated just above the lock. Good fortune is said to come to those who do.\n### Accommodation, morning prayers, and activities at temple lodgings\nThere are 39 temple lodgings on the temple grounds, of which many offer overnight accommodation as well as a place of quiet retreat. Guests staying at the temple lodgings can partake in daily morning prayers and chanting at sunrise when all the monks gather.\n### Experience sutra copying, Zen meditation, and yoga at Daikanjin Temple\nZenkoji Temple (non-sect temple) is protected and administered by Daikanjin Temple (Tendai sect) and Dahongan Temple (Jodo sect). Daikanjin Temple runs regular sutra transcription sessions on the third Sunday of each month and are open to everyone without reservations. Depending on the day of the week, you can participate in, zazen（zen-style meditation）, temple yoga, and tea ceremonies.\n### Surrounding historical and art museums and local gourmet\nThe Zenkoji History Museum, inside the temple grounds, has a collection of Buddhist sculptures which you can view up close. Visitors can enjoy shopping and dining along Nakamise-dori, a street within the precincts of the temple, or Omotesando Avenue, a street that leads outside the precincts of the temple. Alternatively, they can appreciate Japanese aesthetics at the nearby Nagano Prefectural Museum of Art. The Hokusai Museum, near Obuse Station, is a mere 30-minute train ride from Nagano Station.\n## Keywords"}

If you are not staying, you can still use the largest Oyu bath for a small fee, payable at the information center.\n### Taste some local sake\nIn the evening, stroll the narrow lanes in your yukata robe and geta wooden sandals, going from bath to bath or bar to bar. Try some of the local sake at Tamamura, a brewery near Shibu Onsen.\n### Explore the neighboring area\nShibu Onsen is only a 10-minute bus ride from the entrance leading into the famed Snow Monkey Park, and 30 minutes from Shiga Kogen Ski Resort.

A quiet ravine in the northern part of Nagano Prefecture is home to one of the world's most unique attractions. Jigokudani Yaen Koen (Snow Monkey Park) is one of the habitats of a population of Japanese macaques, and visitors have the opportunity to view these illusive creatures up close. During winter months, you can even see them soaking in the area's hot springs to keep warm.\n### Don't Miss\n- The walk up to the Wild Snow Monkey Park through peaceful woodland\n- Observing the way the monkeys behave\n- The zen expressions of the older monkeys relaxing in the hot water\n## How to Get There\nThe monkeys live way out in the mountains, and getting there takes some time.\nThe good news is that buses run to Kanbayashi Onsen near the trail leading into the park from many popular destinations around the prefecture, including Nagano (40 minutes), Nozawa Onsen (30 minutes), Shiga Kogen (30 minutes), and Yudanaka and Shibu Onsen (10 minutes).\nFrom Kanbayashi Onsen it's a 25 to 40-minute walk on a trail through the forest to the Snow Monkey Park. The trail is passable all year round.\n### Quick Facts\nJapanese macaques, also called snow monkeys, have the northernmost range of the world's non-human primates\nThe park is also known as the Jigokudani Monkey Park, or the Jigokudani Yaen Koen\n### More fun than a bath full of monkeys\nIn the Shiga Kogen foothills along the Yokoyu River lies Jigokudani, or Hell's Valley. It's under deep snow for a third of the year and its rugged surroundings and geothermal activity conjure up a similarity with Hades. The surrounding forests and mountains are home to multiple troops of monkeys, numbering in the hundreds.\nThe Snow Monkey Park was established in 1964 as a facility where wild Japanese macaques can be observed in an environment without fences or cages. All this while providing others with the chance to learn about primate behavior.\nThe park also aimed to keep the monkeys in the area and away from their other great love, pillaging the neighboring farmland. Staff at the park have fed the monkeys daily ever since its opening. They live in the surrounding mountains, but come down for the free meals.\nThe monkeys visit the park year-round, and can be seen soaking in the hot springs in winter. December to March is usually the best time to witness them bathing.\n### Go ape over Japan's hottest macaques\nThe two-kilometer path from Kanbayashi Onsen runs through a quiet forest. During winter the trail is particularly beautiful. Signage along the path through the forest to the baths tells visitors about macaque social hierarchy, behavior and child rearing.\nThese laid back tree swingers have their own lives, and bathe as they please. They're also thoroughly used to humans being around, so you'll be able to get photos, but will usually be completely ignored.\n### Monkey see, monkey don't (park etiquette)\nDon't feed them, touch, or threaten the monkeys. Do not stare or look into their eyes, as this can be seen as a sign of aggression. Don't get too close, and whatever you do, don't join them in the bath!\n### When the day is done\nOnce you've finished monkeying around, head to nearby Yudanaka or Shibu Onsen for a soak yourself. Or better yet, spend the night at one of the local inns for a monkey-free onsen experience.\nFor those planning some winter sports after a day with the macaques, Shiga Kogen and Nozawa Onsen are both a half-hour bus ride away.\n## Keywords"}

Osaka and Kyoto also have a shinkansen connection to Nagoya, followed by the Shinano Express to Nagano.\nThe Nagano Electric Railway will bring you from Nagano to Obuse. The museum is just a 12-minute walk from Obuse Station.\n### The master in Obuse\nHokusai Katsushika was a master of Ukiyo-e, a Japanese genre of painting and woodblock printing that flourished between the late 17th and late 19th centuries.\nThe word \"ukiyo\" means \"this world\" or \"the present world.\" Ukiyoe is an artform featuring depictions of the everyday themes preferred by ordinary people, including scenes of daily life in cities and towns, beautiful women, and travel landscapes. Hokusai's famous Thirty-Six Views of Mt. Fuji series was one of these. It includes the renowned painting of the Great Wave off Kanagawa. This Japanese aesthetic, and Hokusai's work, in particular, influenced Western artists like Monet and Van Gogh.\nWhen he arrived in Obuse in 1844 at the behest of a local merchant, Takai Kozan (1806–1883), Hokusai was one of Japan's most prominent artists. Working from his studio annex, he created a variety of new works. The Hokusai Museum is a treasure trove of his work.\nEstablished in 1976, it includes woodblock prints, hanging scrolls, and two intricately decorated festival floats, as well as many other works. The museum displays some of Hokusai's rare three-dimensional work.\nHokusai's elaborate ceiling mural at Ganshoin Temple, located about two kilometers away, is a must-see. This Soto Zen temple was founded in 1472, and Hokusai's mural there was one of his final large-scale installations. It's a 30-minute walk or 10-minute bus ride from central Obuse.\nNot far from the Hokusai Museum is the Takai Kozan Memorial Museum. Here you can view some of Takai Kozan's own work, and the historical Yuzenro building, where literati and artists such as Gyosai and Shozan had discussions with Kozan.\n### While in Obuse\nObuse has a reputation as one of Japan's most scenic small towns. Streets paved with blocks of chestnut wood are great for slow strolls while popping into the refurbished townscape's many shops and cafes.\nThe town has long been famous for its chestnuts. You can try all kinds of chestnut confectionaries and cakes at one of Obuse's many charming cafes.\nLocal sake is popular, with some brews still handcrafted in cedar barrels. Stop by Masuichi-Ichimura brewery or Matsubaya for samples.\n## Keywords"}

This medieval fortress, a National Treasure, is one of Japan's premier historic castles and should not be missed if you're passing through the Nagano area.\n### Don't Miss\n- One of the castle's many seasonal events\n- The gorgeous reflection of the illuminated castle in the moat at night\n- See the Japanese carp (koi fish) that live in the castle's moat\n## How to Get There\nMatsumoto is easily accessible via JR lines from Tokyo's Shinjuku Station, Nagoya, and Nagano City.\nFrom Shinjuku catch a Super Azusa train bound for Matsumoto. From Nagano City and Nagoya take the JR Shinano limited express train. There's also convenient bus service from Takayama in neighboring Gifu Prefecture.\nThe castle is a 15-minute walk north of Matsumoto Station. You can also get there in just five minutes via the colorful Town Sneaker bus.\n### Wander the grounds of a great castle\nMatsumoto Castle is one of the grandest castles in Japan. Its five-tiered, six-story main tower, built in late 16th century, is the oldest surviving castle tower in the nation.\nIt's famously photogenic, with a wide moat, vermillion bridges, and original stonework, backdropped by views of the Northern Alps.\n### Entering the grounds\nEntry to the outer grounds is free. Here you can watch the swans swim around the castle moat; and stand by the water's edge to witness the carp team to the surface. Visit again in the evening when the castle is illuminated and join the locals soaking up the welcoming atmosphere while you check out the reflection of the castle in the water.\nBy day, costumed ninja and samurai prowl the grounds, entertaining kids and posing for photographs with travelers from around the world.\n### Climb the tower for a taste of history\nFor a small fee you can enter the castle's inner grounds. Though the castle tower acted as a fort, the nobility also lived in a palace within its walls. This area is now a pleasant garden where you get an up-close view of the castle before going inside.\n### Look out for all the details\nAscending the steep staircases through Matsumoto Castle's original wooden interior is a one-of-a-kind experience. Its openings for archers and displays of medieval weaponry and armor conjure images of the battles of old. The view from the top floor observation platform across the city to the Northern Alps is nothing short of superb.\n### Fun on the castle doorstep\nCheck to see if Matsumoto Castle is holding an event while you're in town. Seasonal festivals on the grounds include Japanese taiko drumming in summer, a soba noodle event in the fall, and an ice-sculpture festival in the winter.\n### Spring time on the castle grounds\nThe hundreds of cherry trees in the area outside the castle moat burst into bloom in April. The grounds come alive with blossom viewing parties, especially stunning at night when the trees are illuminated.\n### More in Matsumoto\nWithin easy walking distance of the castle you'll find a host of pubs and restaurants on the quaint and quirky riverside Nawate pedestrian lane, nicknamed \"Frog Street.\" The atmospheric Nakamachi Street with its distinct historical architecture is also a must.\n## Keywords"}

Whether for a leisurely walk along the Azusa River or an extended trek in the mountains, visiting Kamikochi is a must for any visit to Nagano Prefecture.\n### Don't Miss\n- Experience the spectacular views of the Hotaka Range peaks from Kappabashi Bridge\n- Take a hike out to Myojin Pond\n- Go for a trekking adventure in the alpine wonderland of the Northern Japan Alps\n## How to Get There\nKamikochi is not the easiest place to access, so research accordingly before heading off.\nIf you want to travel by train, aim to get to Matsumoto Station and jump on a train to Shin-Shimashima. From there, you'll have to take a bus as private cars are banned from Kamikochi.\nThere are direct bus services that depart from Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto, and Nagano.\n### Quick Facts\nAt 1,500 meters, Kamikochi and the surrounding peaks are all part of the Chubu Sangaku National Park\nKamikochi is accessible from mid-April until mid-November, but you can snowshoe during winter\n### Peak season\nKamikochi is popular throughout its open season but is especially busy during summer holidays from mid-July through to August and on weekends during the autumn foliage season.\n### Stand in awe amid the beauty of Kamikochi\nWhile certain famous destinations can never live up to their hype, Kamikochi is rightfully renowned. The fifteen-kilometer (approx.) valley, with its lush forests, offers stunning views of the surrounding peaks, including the volcanic Mt. Yakedake. The Hotaka mountain range dominates the area, and at 3,190 meters, Mt. Oku Hotaka is the highest peak in the Northern Japan Alps.\n### An introduction to the area\nThe bus into Kamikochi arrives at a visitor's center not far from Kappabashi Bridge, a 36.6-meter wooden structure spanning the Azusa River. It's a major Kamikochi landmark, and one of its most popular spots for snapping photos.\nWhile the valley as a whole is relatively undeveloped, the central area has some guest houses, hotels, and a smattering of shops and restaurants. This zone can get busy at times, but if you keep hiking along the river, you'll soon be away from the crowds.\n### Hike along the turquoise Azusa River\nCasual day hikes from this area along the turquoise Azusa River can be supremely rewarding with tremendous views along the way. Myojin Pond and Taisho Pond are both popular sightseeing spots for their pristine waters which reflect the surrounding peaks. Keep your eyes peeled for the troops of monkeys that frequently come romping through.\n### Climb into the wild Northern Japan Alps\nHeading towards Myojin Pond, hike further still and you'll soon begin the ascent into Japan's alpine realm. Along the way, the valley's forest foliage presents a mix of larch, birch, and hemlock. It's also home to such local wildlife like deer, the Japanese breed serow, raccoon dogs, foxes, plenty of monkeys, and the occasional bear.\n### An autumnal delight\nThe valley is at its most splendid in the fall. While legions of visitors descend on Kamikochi in October, if you keep walking up the river valley, you'll soon leave most of them behind. Another option is doing a day hike up nearby Mt. Yakedake; this path lets you take in the autumn hues minus the crowds.\n### Snowshoeing in winter\nSnowshoeing into Kamikochi is an amazing way to experience the valley in the off-season. With the park officially closed during winter, this is a unique opportunity to experience Kamikochi without any vehicles or crowds. A winter hike from the tunnel at the entrance of the resort to Kappabashi Bridge takes about two and a half hours. You can rent snowshoes in Matsumoto.\n## Keywords"}

Located on the border of Nagano and Yamanashi prefectures and with the fascinating Suwa region at its doorstep, these mountains provide a great opportunity to venture deep into nature in upland Japan.\nThere are many routes up Mt. Yatsugatake and the other peaks in the range, and you've also got a choice of day and multi-day options. If you're into onsen, you may want to hike up to Honzawa Onsen for a mountain-high soak. Along the way, you may even come across some of the creatures that inhabit these mountains.\n### Don't Miss\n- Hiking the rolling Kirigamine Highland\n- Spotting Japanese wildlife in Yatsugatake's forests\n- Japan's highest outdoor bath, Honzawa Onsen\n## How to Get There\nYou can reach the Yatsugatake Mountains most easily from Chino Station in the Suwa region.\nFrom Shinjuku catch the JR Azusa Chuo Line-Limited Express for Matsumoto and get off at Chino Station. From there, buses run to various Yatsugatake trailheads, Lake Shirakaba, and the Kirigamine Highlands. While infrequent buses connect certain sites in the foothills, a rental car expands the possibility for exploration.\n### Mt. Fuji's biggest rival\nWhile Fuji may top Yatsugatake in height, when it comes to stunning alpine landscapes and the sheer number of trekking options available, the Yatsugatake Mountains are second to none.\n### Scaling the peaks\nYatsugatake can roughly be divided into two areas: the northern stretch of the range is not as high, with lots of easier hikes, while the southern section has dense forest, rugged peaks and offers true alpine trekking.\n### Check out the fuzzy locals\nThe area is home to some fascinating wildlife including flying squirrels, deer, Japanese serows, raccoon dogs, foxes and the occasional bear. The alpine flowers in summertime draw camera-toting trekkers from across the nation and beyond.\n### Trekking the long and winding trails\nA staggering number of paths wind their way through the Yatsugatake Mountains, offering everything from short walks to multiday alpine excursions. At 2,646 meters, Mt. Tengu makes for a perfect day hike.\nIf you're feeling adventurous, you can try the two-day, overnight loop that traverses Yatsugatake's main southern ridge, including Mt. Io, Mt. Yokodake, and Mt. Akadake.\n### It's all part of the experience\nStaying overnight at a Japanese mountain lodge is a memorable experience. There are over 30 lodges located across the range, each with its own personality and range of facilities. Some aspects are standard, though. As at a traditional Japanese inn, everyone eats together in the dining room.\n### Communal accommodations are the rule\nThe sleeping area is communal as well; most often, you end up sleeping Japanese style, side by side on futon, on traditional tatami flooring. Usually, everyone is up at the crack of dawn for breakfast and an early start on the trail. If you don't want to hike with a crowd, take a nap after breakfast and head out later.\n### Erase your cares away\nThere are plenty of onsen in the area. For the energetic and adventurous, hiking to Honzawa Onsen—set halfway up Mt. Io—will reward you with a relaxing session in Japan's highest outdoor bath.\n### Vacation wonderland in the foothills\nThe plateau between Kirigamine and Yatsugatake's Mt. Tateshina is very popular in the summertime. The artificial Lake Shirakaba and its nearby theme park are fantastic destinations for families and couples escaping the Tokyo summer heat.\n### More to explore\nIf you're on the hunt for something else to round out your day, there are a number of museums and galleries in the area. The quirky Tateshina Teddy Bear Museum has a monumental collection of stuffed denizens; the Yatsugatake Museum of Art displays work by local artists and craftspeople changing with the seasons; and Chino's historic Togariishi Museum of Jomon Archaeology houses priceless artifacts dating back to the Suwa region's earliest pre-historic inhabitants.\n## Keywords"}

These include the Kamisha Honmiya and Kamisha Maemiya of the Kamisha (upper shrine group) located on the southern shore of Lake Suwa, and the Shimosha Akimiya and Shimosha Harumiya of the Shimosha (lower shrine group) on the northern shore of Lake Suwa. Its Onbashira Festival held only once every seventh year is renowned across Japan for its unique and dynamic events, making it popular with both locals and visitors from outside of the area.\n### Don't Miss\n- Observe the posts at each shrine's four corners, carried from the mountains during Onbashira Festival\n- Cleanse your hands before entering the grounds at the unusual chozuya that spouts hot spring water\n- Visit the Manji no Sekibutsu stone Buddhist statue near Shimosha Harumiya that is revered for its spiritual power\n## How to Get There\nKamisha (upper shrine group) : From JR Kami-Suwa Station, the main Kamisha Honmiya is about 50 minutes by bus or 15 minutes by taxi. From Kamisha Honmiya it's about a 30-minute walk to Kamisha Maemiya, and a further 30-minute walk from Kamisha Maemiya to JR Chino Station.\nShimosha (lower shrine group): Shimosha Akimiya is a 10-minute walk from JR Shimo-Suwa Station, followed by a 15-minute walk from Shimosha Akimiya to Shimosha Harumiya. From Shimosha Harumiya it is 15-minute walk back to JR Shimo-Suwa Station.\nIf taking the Azusa Limited Express from Shinjuku Station in Tokyo, it's a two-hour ride to Chino Station. Two hours 15 minutes to Kami-Suwa Station, and two hours 20 minutes to Shimo-Suwa Station. A direct express bus service also operates from Shinjuku's express bus terminal.\n### Quick Facts\nTravel between the Kamisha (upper shrine group) and Shimosha (lower shrine group) groups takes about 30 minutes by car\nSuwa Taisha Shrine's Kamisha revere the mountain and the Shimosha worship the trees\nGiant 200-year-old fir trees are cut down and then slid down the mountainside some 10-20 kilometers to the nearby village during the Onbashira Festival, held once every seven years\n### Touring the four shrines\nAccording to the Kojiki, Japan's oldest existing compilation of history, traditions, and legends (created in 712), the origin of Suwa Taisha Shrine began during an event known as the kuni-yuzuri, where rulership over Japan was passed from the gods of the heaven to the gods of the land. One such god of the land, Takeminakata-no-kami, was defeated during a power struggle and fled to Suwa. There, they created the land of Shinano (now Nagano) and were enshrined as Suwa Myojin at Suwa Taisha Shrine.\nThere is no hierarchy between shrines, so it's fine to visit just one group or the other due to the distance that divides them. However, if you have the time or are traveling by car, then visiting all four shrines is recommended. Visitors who do so and collect their red ink stamps will receive a memento.\n### An ancient shrine with nature as its deity\nWhile the Kamisha (upper shrine group) shrines sitting at the foot of Mt. Moriya reveres the mountain as its sacred body, the Shimosha (lower shrine group) shrines worship large trees — Shimosha Akimiya worships a large yew tree and Shimosha Harumiya a large cedar tree. This is a characteristic of shrines that lack a Honden, the most sacred building within a Shinto shrine complex, worshipping the surrounding nature instead.\n### Kamisha Maemiya (upper shrine group)\nKamisha Maemiya is considered the birthplace of the Suwa faith as it is where the deity (Suwa Myojin) first arrived. Suwa Myojin is widely worshipped as a guardian deity of agriculture, industry, victory, and military fortune.\n### Kamisha Honmiya (upper shrine group)\nA great number of historic structures remain on the precincts of the Kamisha Honmiya complex — the other kamisha. The Shikyakumon Gate built in 1608, the Nunohashi Bridge built in 1777, and the hall of worship built in 1857, are all definitely worth seeing. The approach to the temple is also lined with souvenir stores and restaurants, where visitors can take a break while enjoying the local delicacies.\n### Shimosha Harumiya (lower shrine group)\nThe layout of Shimosha Harumiya is similar to the Shimosha Akimiya. The Kagura Hall stands in front, adorned with sacred “shime-nawa” rope. And behind this, lies the Houden treasure hall, sacred tree, and the Heihaiden Hall (a hall of worship). In the precincts of the Heihaiden Hall, built in 1799, stands two united cedar trees which are joined at the base and fork out from each other. Many consider them to be a united matchmaking tree. A 5-minute walk from the shrine grounds is the Manji-no-Sekibutsu, a stone Buddha that is said to grant wishes to those who walk around it three times while chanting their heart's desire.\n### Shimosha Akimiya (lower shrine group)\nThe Heihaiden Hall for the Shimosha Akimiya was built in 1780. This shrine features pair of 1.7-meter bronze komainu (guardian dogs) that stand before the Kagura Hall.\n### The Onbashira Festival, a once-in-every-seventh-year event\nAnother draw to Suwa Taisha Shrine is the Onbashira Festival that is held once every seventh year. 16 giant 200-year-old fir trees are cut down and then slid down the mountainside some 10-20 kilometers to the nearby village. No machinery is involved, and the people rely purely on manpower to transport the trees before they are erected at the four corners of each shrine. A video of the Onbashira Festival can be seen at the official website. Watching this dynamic video scene of the giant trees sliding down the mountainside is strongly recommended before your visit.\nPhoto cooperation; Suwa Tourism Association\nPhoto cooperation; Suwa Tourism Association\n### Information on the Local Area\nFrom lower shrine group to Shimosha Akimiya and Shimosha Harumiya, walk along the Nakasendo trail, one of the Gokaido five trails paved in the Edo period (1603–1867). There are 69 traditional Japanese inns along the Nakasendo trail. The hot spring town of Shimosuwajuku was especially known as the bustling center for weary travelers to who stop and soak away their fatigue in the hot springs. The Shukuba Kaido Museum, along the way, is a great way to catch a glimpse of how merchants lived in those days.\nTraveling between the Kamisha and Shimosha groups takes visitors on a path along the lakeside of Lake Suwa. The route includes a number of interesting sightseeing locations, such as the Suwa Lake Geyser Center, where Kamisuwa onsen gushes forth, and Takashima Castle.\n## Keywords"}

Visit to experience the beautiful Kiso Valley and get a taste of Japan's feudal past.\n### Don't Miss\n- The gorgeous hike between Tsumago and its well-preserved neighbor Magome\n- Exploring the area's ancient waterfalls\n- Visiting Rekishi Shiryokan, a historical museum with good English signage that focuses on the town and Kiso Valley\n## How to Get There\nNagiso Station is the easiest way to access the area from both neighboring and major city centers.\nFrom Tokyo Station, take the Tokaido Shinkansen to Nagoya, then transfer to the JR Shinano Limited Express line for Nagiso Station. From Nagiso Station, Tsumago is a 10-minute bus ride. Buses are infrequent, but taxis are available. You can also hike in from the neighboring post town of Magome in Gifu Prefecture, which marks the southern entrance to the Nakasendo.\n### Quick Facts\nCars are not permitted on the town's main road during the day\nToday Tsumago is considered one of the best-preserved towns in Japan\nThe town's power lines are hidden to maintain its old-worldly atmosphere\n### Where the locals stopped time\nTsumago is an incredible success story of gumption. The village was the 42nd station on the Nakasendo Trail, an Edo period (1603-1867) trade route connecting Kyoto and Edo (modern Tokyo). In 1968, at a time when Japan's urban development was at full tilt, the local council decided to preserve its main street for posterity, including prohibiting cars on the main street during the day and hiding phone lines and power cables from view.\n### Living history\nWhile Japan's castles and temples exalt the elite of the past, Tsumago-juku's main street of humble wooden houses imparts insight into life at a more local level. Lined with shops, restaurants, and inns, be sure to catch Rekishi Shiryokan, a historical museum with good English signage with exhibits introducing the town and Kiso Valley.\n### Explore the Nakasendo Trail\nTsumago is small enough to explore in half a day. One particularly pleasant option is to take a scenic hike on the Nakasendo to the beautifully preserved nearby post town of Magome. The three-hour, nine-kilometer journey takes you through gorgeous landscapes of cypress forests and idyllic farming communities.\n### Witness the ancient waterfalls\nNot far outside of Tsumago-juku, you'll come across a pair of picturesque waterfalls, Otake and Medaki. Named the \"Men's Falls\" and \"Women's Falls,\" these natural baths likely got their names in ancient times when they were used as separate bathing areas.\n### History hidden on every corner\nHidden along the trail are a variety of hidden historical signposts that add to the old-time atmosphere. Noticeboards called kosatsu are located at the entrances of both Tsumago and Magome. These signs carry regulations and decrees from the ruling military government and breaking these rules which would lead to severe consequences in the past.\n### Further afield\nIt's worth spending a weekend or a night at one of Tsumago's local inns to fully appreciate the atmosphere once the crowds clear out. Stroll among the old buildings with their glowing lanterns and feel as though you've slipped back in time\n.\n## Keywords"}

Ontake御嶽山\nKiso-gun, Nagano-ken\n## Kiso's sacred volcano filled with spiritual history\nMt. Ontake, one of Japan's most sacred mountains, has drawn worshippers and pilgrims for over a thousand years. It's home to otherworldly landscapes, an ancient pilgrimage trail, and a nature-focused spiritual culture that thrives to this day.\n### Don't Miss\n- Walking through history on the Ontake Pilgrimage Trail\n- Exploring the summit's volcanic moonscape\n- Mt. Ontake's sacred waterfalls in remote Otaki Village\n## How to Get There\nKiso-Fukushima Station is the closest main station to the mountain's hiking trail, which is a direct connection from Nagano. Getting to and around the area without a car takes a little planning, so be prepared.\nFrom Nagano Station catch the JR Shinano line to Kiso-Fukushima Station. To get to the hiking trail from Kiso-Fukushima Station take a bus bound for Tanohara to the final stop. Buses run only three times a day.\nYou can also take the Ontake Ropeway-bound bus and get off at the gondola. From there you can ride the Ropeway's 2,330 meter journey up the mountain.\n### Quick Facts\nAt 3,067 meters, Mt. Ontake is Japan's second highest volcano\nDue to the 2014 eruption, a one-kilometer area around the crater has been off limits, so check before you visit\nYou can ski down the slopes of Nagano's highest volcano\n### Follow the pilgrim's way\nMt. Ontake's sacred roots reach deep into the past. The religion practiced here is a blend of Shinto, esoteric Buddhism, and ancient shamanic lore. Practitioners still come from across Japan to walk the Ontake Pilgrimage Trail to the summit. In the warmer months of July and August, you'll encounter pilgrims in white performing ceremonies at the holy sites along the way.\n### Ride Kiso's ontake ropeway\nWhile one trail starts at the bottom of the mountain in Kiso, very few walk the whole route today. The easiest way is to take the Ontake Ropeway, which whisks you up to within a couple hours' hike of the summit.\n### Stay the night\nFrom there you can trek the volcanic moon-like landscape, passing the many shrines, and Mt. Ontake's sacred ponds. Covering the whole summit takes five or six hours, but there are lodges where you can stay during the pilgrimage season.\n### Otaki's historic trail and sacred falls\nThe other Ontake Pilgrimage Trail starts in the remote Otaki Village, home to two of the most sacred waterfalls in the region, Kiyotaki and Shintaki falls. For centuries, pilgrims clad in white have stood below these spectacular cascades for purification before ascending Mt. Ontake.\n### Step into another world\nYou can access either of the falls directly, but the hour and a half Ontake Waterfall Trail loop is worth the effort. This takes you through the mountain's beautiful forest lined with shrines and mossy dedications to the divine. The approach to the falls feels like stepping into another realm, especially when the pilgrims are around chanting and conducting their rituals.\n### Skiing Mt. Ontake\nIf you're in Kiso during the winter and want to try some sports, Mt. Ontake has two resorts, Ontake Skijo in Otaki Village, and the Kaida Kogen Maia Ski Area. Both are smaller resorts but offer a fun day in the snow. You'll even be able to tell your friends you skied Nagano's highest volcano.\n## Keywords"}

The 16 courses and 19 lifts offer skiing and boarding options for all levels as well as good backcountry access. The resort holds a variety of events including a New Year's Eve countdown and the Happo-one Fire Festival in February.

The garden was created over the span of several hundred years by the Maeda family, and today is one of the best examples of a strolling-style\nJapanese landscape garden. The garden offers something to enjoy whatever the season.\n\"Kenrokuen\" means “garden that combines six characteristics.\" These six characteristics are spaciousness, seclusion, artifice, antiquity, water sources and magnifient views. Not every garden in Japan can combine all of these features but Kenrokuen does.\n### Don't Miss\n- The naturally-powered water fountain below Kasumigaike Pond, which reaches 3.5 meters high\n- Seisonkaku Villa for its two distinct styles of Japanese architecture\n- Kotojitoro Lantern, the symbol of the garden, known for its two-legged design\n## How to Get There\nKenrokuen is easily accessed by bus from Kanazawa Station.\nThe ride takes 20 minutes and costs 200 yen. Alternatively, JR Rail Pass holders can take the JR buses bound for Korinbo using their passes. The garden is central to many of Kanazawa's main attractions.\n### The garden's evolution\nKenrokuen was once a private garden belonging to the Maeda family, who reigned over the Kaga domain from Kanazawa Castle. The Maeda family was one of the most powerful in the country in feudal times after the shogun's family. Construction began in 1676 with a landscape garden called Renchitei and the garden continues to evolve over three centuries.\nIn 1822, the garden took its present name and in 1874, the garden was opened to the public.\n### Experience the mindfulness of samurai times\nEvery feature of a traditional Japanese garden is present here: ponds, stone lanterns, waterfalls, stone paths, bridges, streams, tea houses and artificial hills. In this natural environment, you can easily spend at least a few hours absorbing the peaceful surroundings, designed for meditative practices during the feudal era.\n### Enjoy Kenrokuen whatever the season\nPlum blossoms and then cherry blossoms bloom in spring, and there are a variety of flowers to see in summer, such as azalea. In fall, the garden comes alive with the blazing red Japanese maple leaves. The word \"momijigari\" refers to the hunt for spotting this stunning maple and this garden is the place to be. Come winter, the snow-covered pine trees along the pond offer romantic views. The trees are also illuminated for a short period in January and February.\nYukitsuri\n### Strung-up trees\nYou may have noticed that pine trees in the winter in Japan often have what looks like an umbrella of ropes strung from a pole above them and reaching down to the lower branches. This is the yukitsuri, a conical array of ropes built to support the branches of the trees and thereby prevent them from breaking under the weight of the heavy snowfalls of the winter. These are, after all, old trees—especially Kenrokuen's famous 200-year-old pine. Setting up the yukitsuri starts November 1 and they remain until around March 15.\n### Magnificent traditional Japanese villa\nAt the southeast end of the garden, you will find a villa built in 1863 by Lord Nariyasu Maeda as a comfortable retirement home for his mother. The enormous two-story structure is built in two styles. The main floor is built in a style called buke-shoin, a formal setting meant for receiving guests, and the second-floor design is called sukiya-shoin, featuring red, blue, and purple colors, giving it a more playful and relaxing atmosphere.\nSeisonkaku Villa also functions as a museum, displaying dolls, kimono, and paintings.\n### Around Kenrokuen\nThe garden connects to Kanazawa Castle. Simply cross the bridge once out of the Ishikawa gate. Outside of the garden's Katsurazaka gate, the pedestrian road is lined with small restaurants and cafes serving casual lunch dishes, tea, and ice cream covered in gold leaf. Kanazawa accounts for 99% percent of all domestic gold leaf production. Several cafes, shops, and even museums offer gold leaf in various forms. The very strong presence of traditional arts and crafts in Kanazawa is a reflection of the strength and wealth of the Maeda family and their commitment to the arts.\nThere are several museums accessible on foot nearby, including the 21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art, the Ishikawa Prefectural Museum of Art, as well as places to further explore and learn various expressions of Japanese culture, such as the Kaga Yuzen Kimono Center and the Kanazawa Noh Museum.\n## Keywords"}

The most popular entrance is through the Ishikawamon Gate.\nFrom the station there are several local buses, including the Kanazawa Loop Bus, which stops in front of the Ishikawamon Gate, located only a few meters from the entrance of Kenrokuen Garden.\n### Quick Facts\nIt is located adjacent to the famous Kenrokuen Garden, which was once the castle's private outer garden.\nIt has the biggest variety of stone walls of any castle in Japan.\n### A long history\nKanazawa Castle is a partially-restored castle located within the Kanazawa Castle Park, directly across from Kenrokuen Garden. The Maeda family began construction in 1583, and the family resided there for fourteen generations until 1869. Today, not much remains of the original castle, which was destroyed by fire many times over the centuries due to natural disasters. Two of the surviving structures of the castle are the Ishikawamon Gate and Sanjikken Nagaya Warehouse. During the Meiji period (1868-1912) the castle became Japanese army headquarters, and then was used by Kanazawa University until 1996.\n### Great restoration\nSince then, a major restoration project has been underway, recreating the structures using original construction techniques. Although castles in Japan were built mainly for defense purposes, long periods of peace during the Edo period allowed architects to put emphasis on aesthetics, resulting in the beautiful horizontal lines of the roof gables and the carved wooden decorations underneath, called gegyo.\nIn the center of the castle park, you can enter three restored large-scale wooden buildings for a small fee, which are reconstructions of the buildings that existed 125 years ago. These are the Hishiyagura Turret, Gojukken Najaya Warehouse, and Hashizumemon Tsuzuki Turret. Inside the buildings, there are intricate displays and models of the castle, showing the various architectural techniques used in the restoration.\n### Guarding the castle\nTake a look out of the narrow windows of the top floors of the turrets to see a view below of the castle grounds, moat and garden. You'll be able to imagine what it was like to defend the castle from enemy attackers, and get a sense of how important the solid and meticulous design of the castle was for protection.\nIn addition to the buildings, the castle also has a variety of stone walls which were constructed using a variety of different techniques. Some of the walls were made in a very sophisticated style, and look like a mosaic, whereas others have a more broken-up look. The castle park is sometimes referred to as a stone wall museum due to the different eras and styles in which the walls were constructed.\n## Keywords"}

A sense of symmetry pervades the layout of the buildings, which you will want to explore at leisure as you move through the temple complex.\n### Don't Miss\n- The magnificent Somon and Sanmon gates leading into the temple grounds\n- The stately kawarabuki-tiled roof of the Butsuden, and it's object of worship: a statue of Shakyamuni, the historical Buddha\n- The chance to see the complex illuminated at night as part of a special sound and light show held in spring (please see the official site for the latest information)\n## How to Get There\nZuiryuji Temple is located in central Takaoka City, a 15-minute walk from the main train station.\nJR Rail Pass holders can take the Hokuriku Shinkansen (connecting Tokyo, Kanazawa) to Shin-Takaoka. Once there, transfer to the Johana Line for a three-minute journey to Takaoka. If you do not have a rail pass, you can also take the Ainokaze Line from Toyama to Takaoka, a direct trip taking only 17 minutes.\n### Illuminated beauty\nWhether you are just passing through Takaoka or planning on spending a day or more in the area, Zuiryuji can easily be worked into a tour of local attractions. However, a son et lumiere (sound and light) attraction usually held at the end of April at the temple is a beautiful sight to behold. For a small fee you can also enjoy the night market, which is usually held at the same time. Expect to pay a small fee, and plan ample time to take in the festive atmosphere as well as explore the concurrently held local night markets.\n### A bold yet simple ambiance\nTwo large gates leading into the temple precinct are among the architectural highlights. The larger of the two, or Sanmon, houses two Nio guardian statues of fierce demeanor. The meticulously groomed courtyards of raked gravel are a hallmark of Zen temple design.\nAt the center of Zuiryuji stands the Butsuden, so named because it houses a statue of the temple's main object of worship, Shakyamuni, the historical Buddha. As the most impressive structure in the compound, the eclectic mix of carvings inside makes the butsuden's interior as aesthetically pleasing as the exterior, and you'll want to take your time to examine them all individually.\n### Historical significance\nZuiryuji's history interweaves with that of Takaoka's founder, Maeda Toshinaga, and his brother Toshitsune. Toshinaga commissioned the building (called Hoenji at that time) shortly before his death in 1614. His successor Toshitsune renamed the temple in Toshinaga's honor (“Zuiryu,” was his posthumous name). The figure of Maeda Toshinaga still looms large over Takaoka, and as one of his foremost legacies, Zuiryuji forms part of the cultural fabric of present-day Toyama.\n## Keywords"}

Its Japanese name literally means \"forest of beauties,\" and it's easy to see why—the myriad beech trees stand tall and gracefully, like the silhouettes of beautiful women.\nColors change continuously throughout the seasons, but the forest maintains a fairytale look all year round.\n### Rice terraces\nTanada (rice terraces) are rice fields that line the mountain slopes like steps in a staircase. The tanada found resting high and low in the mountains of the Matsunoyama and Matsudai areas of Tokamachi City are some of the most impressive in all of Japan. Their appearance transitions with the seasons, producing vibrantly different expressions as the year progresses. In spring and autumn, each field shines like a mirror as it reflects the setting sun, and in winter a snowy blanket is cast across the landscape. Tokamachi's Hoshitoge Rice Terraces in particular attract thousands of photographers and tourists throughout the year; they are truly a sight to be seen!\n### Winter fun in Tokamachi\nEvery year in February, the City of Tokamachi puts on the Tokamachi Snow Festival that showcases local residents' talents. Snow sculptures of popular cartoon characters and cultural figures line the streets of the city.\nSnow-based games and delicious warm foods can also be found throughout the festival area.\nThere are also a handful of ski resorts around the area perfect for avid skiers and newbies alike. These resorts are not limited to just skiing, but also snowboarding and tubing. Winter is also a great time for creating snow huts, snow camping, and many more activities!\n### A world-renowned art festival\nEvery three years Tokamachi is host to the Echigo-Tsumari Art Triennale, a huge international art exhibition that features around 300 works of art scattered around an area the same size as Tokyo's 23 wards. Art aficionados and casual fans alike can witness the unique combination of artwork with nature not only as a backdrop, but a component to art. The festival includes permanent installations by artists Yayoi Kusama, James Turrell, and dozens more.\n### More about Tokamachi's specialties\nLike many other mountainous areas, Tokamachi is home to plenty of natural hot springs. The Matsunoyama Onsen Village has one of the top medicinal onsen in Japan which is sure to soothe your body and heal you from the inside out.\nIf you're looking to try Tokamachi's local specialty food, make your way to a soba noodle shop. Tokamachi's specialty dish is called “hegisoba,” and unlike normal soba, which uses white flour as a binding agent, hegisoba uses funori, a type of seaweed. This is heavily linked to the textile production in Tokamachi, as seaweed threads were used in fabric weaving and materials were not wasted. The seaweed gives the soba noodle a firm but smooth texture. Furthering its connection with textiles, the soba is arranged in a tray (known as hegi) in loops that look similar to threads used during textile production.\n## Keywords"}

Asama (Nagano)浅間山\nKitasaku-gun, Nagano-ken\n## Get up close to Honshu's most active volcano\nAt 2,568 meters, restless Mt. Asama can often be seen with smoke curling skyward. It last erupted in 2019 but has since calmed down. An excursion here will give you a new view of the Northern Japan Alps.\n### Don't Miss\n- The otherworldly volcanic landscape of Onioshidashi Park\n- Reaching Mt. Asama's smoky summit\n## How to Get There\nMt. Asama is accessible by bus.\nThe town of Komoro is a frequent starting point for hikes up Mt. Asama. From Karuizawa, the Shinano Tetsudo Line runs to Komoro Station which takes about 25 minutes. From there, a bus runs to the trailhead at Takamine Kogen Onsen.\n### Explore Onioshidashi Park\nLava flows from Mt. Asama's massive 1783 eruption created the surreal expanse of Onioshidashi Park (Gunma Prefecture). The landscape is a chaotic mass of jagged volcanic formations, with occasional patches of greenery pushing through. Plenty of walking trails with superb views of looming Mt. Asama make this area a great place to start. Asamayama Kannondo Temple is also located here. Dedicated to Kannon, the Buddhist goddess of compassion, it was built in remembrance of those who perished in the disaster. A visit to the Asama Volcano Museum will give you insight into the area's geological activity.\n### Get a stunning view near the top of the mountain\nFrom the trailhead at Takamine Kogen Onsen, the trek to the summit takes about 3.5 hours. While there are some steep sections, it should be manageable for those of average fitness. You'll pass through dense forest before moving above the tree line into the mountain's volcanic realm. From that point on, there are fantastic views of the Northern Japan Alps, the Yatsugatake Mountains, and beyond. Eventually, you'll reach an area near the top of the mountain that's roped off, warning you not to get too close to the smoking crater.\n### Cautions and advice\nAt the time of writing, there's a level one warning in place for Mt. Asama from the Japan Meteorological Agency, meaning that “it is noted to be an active volcano.” Please check the current conditions before you head out. Bring a map, as well as warm and waterproof clothing, even in summer. Weather in the Japanese mountains can change in a flash.\n### Don't forget the hot spring after your climb\nBe sure to check the return bus times. If possible, try to leave time for a hot spring bath at Takamine Kogen Onsen after your climb. An outdoor bath in the mountain air at 2,000 meters is unforgettable.\nThe latest information may differ, so please check the official website\n## Keywords"}

The distinct aroma will guide you to the yubatake—literally translated as hot water field — in the center of town. Geothermal water rises to the surface straight from the source and is cooled as it runs along a series of connected wooden chutes while maintaining the natural mineral content.\nHot steam billows as the water gushes down into the emerald reservoir. Kusatsu Onsen has the largest amount of naturally occurring hot spring water in Japan.\nWith high temperatures (around 55 degrees Celsius) and high acidity, the water is said to cure many conditions and is especially good for your skin. Several Tokugawa shoguns had the water transported in barrels to their castle in Edo (now Tokyo).\n### Hot spring traditions\nFrom the yubatake, you can easily stroll to Netsunoyu hall to watch the yumomi performance. Onsen workers cool the water by dipping and turning wooden planks, churning the water to the rhythm of a folk song.\n### Strolling and shopping\nTake the narrow alley near the Netsunoyu and explore the quaint arts and crafts shops, featuring milky glass inspired by the waters. Be sure to try onsen manju (steamed sweet buns) and onsen tamago (eggs boiled in the hot springs). You can follow the alley all the way to Sainokawara Park, an area where steamy hot spring water gushes naturally.\n## Keywords"}

From there, transfer to the Keikyu Airport Line bound for Haneda Airport. Journeys from Shinagawa can take up to 30 minutes.\nBy monorail: Departing from JR Hamamatsucho Station, also on the Yamanote Line, the Tokyo Monorail provides a scenic seaside journey to Haneda Airport. Airport Express services take as little as 13 minutes.\nBy bus: A number of limousine buses service Haneda Airport from major train stations and hotels in the greater Tokyo area.\nBy taxi: Various providers offer flat-rate taxi services to and from Haneda Airport. Late-night services and expressway surcharges cost extra.\nWhen planning your journey, be aware that public transport in Tokyo doesn't run 24 hours. The first connections to the airport via the Tokyo Monorail and Keikyu Railways reach Terminal 3 around 5:15 and 5:30. Early morning bus services from the center of Tokyo and Yokohama start arriving around 4:30. For late-night arrivals, the last trains and buses into the city end just after midnight.\n### Haneda's history\nHaneda Airport opened as Tokyo Haneda Airfield in 1931. The airfield was centrally located in the country and served scheduled domestic flights and goodwill flights. In 1978 most international flights were relocated to the newly constructed Narita Airport, and Haneda became a domestic airport. However, the number of air passengers and airlines has been increasing, and Haneda has expanded to accommodate the growing demand for air travel. In 2010 the airport's international terminal, Terminal 3, was opened. There are also plans for a new train line to open that connects Tokyo Station and Haneda in around 18 minutes.\n### Airlines at Haneda\nAll Nippon Airways (ANA), Japan Airlines (JAL) and many other domestic and international airlines operate flights to and from Haneda.\n### What to do when you're not flying\nAs the busiest airport in Japan (and one of the top five busiest in the world), Haneda has everything you'd expect from a modern domestic and international airport. Free Wi-Fi, airport lounges, and a variety of dining and shopping options are all at hand.\nUnique to Haneda, Edo Alley is a shopping and dining area in Terminal 3 that recreates an Edo streetscape, giving a feel for Tokyo of yesteryear. To enhance the effect, Edo Alley is accessed by crossing a replica of Nihonbashi, the historic center point of all roads in Japan. If you're in Terminal 1, look for Haneda's own aviation shrine and pray for a safe flight.\nFor more modern Japan, visit Tokyo Pop Town, which stocks a wide array of anime, manga, and character merchandise. Or consider renting a \"Robohon\" for a robot guided tour.\n### Accommodation\nFor flights arriving or departing outside of public transport hours, or if you just want to rest up, accommodations are available in each terminal.\nTerminal 3 (the international terminal) and Terminal 2 both offer standard hotel accommodations, while Terminal 1 has the first-class-themed compact hotel First Cabin on site for a comfortable sleeping experience.\nTravelers can stay at one of the accommodation options in and around Otorii and Anamori-Inari stations on the Keikyu Airport Line, many of which offer free shuttle buses for guests.\n## Keywords"}

The train is covered by the Japan Rail Pass, but the bus is not. Be aware that buses only depart Oishida Station every 60-90 minutes.\nVisitors traveling by car are required to park at a designated parking area outside the town center. Many inns offer a shuttle service into town from the lot.\n### Get to know the onsen-kyo\nPopular among Japanese travelers, the term onsen-kyo is associated with small, quaint towns and cozy inns that offer accommodation, food and hot spring bathing. As weekend retreats, they are popular with all age groups, from young families to retirees. This cherished aspect of travel in Japan often goes unnoticed by foreign visitors, so live like a local and dive into onsen-kyo culture.\nThe area is a car-free town center with no modern buildings in sight.\nHaving checked into one of the town's many inns, visitors walk the streets without the usual concern of cars zipping past to beat the traffic light.\nIn the proud tradition of Japanese inns, Ginzan Onsen's ryokan offer up sumptuous local dishes to meet the standards of their mostly Japanese clientele.\n### Such stuff as dreams are made of\nBeautiful buildings surrounded by an unspoiled rural setting ensure that Ginzan Onsen is pleasant all year round. Long summer days are perfect for lazy strolls down idyllic streets in a yukata. In winter, the town really works its magic. The sight of the buildings blanketed in snow and illuminated by the soft glow of gaslights leaves a lasting impression.\nMany Japanese visitors come to Ginzan Onsen in search of its Taisho period ambience. Anyone familiar with Mishima Yukio's novel 'Spring Snow' will delight at how the setting blends traditional Japanese aesthetics with what was once seen as modern sophistication. The gaslights and absence of motor vehicles help maintain the atmosphere.\n### The finer points of hot spring bathing\nRotenburo are outdoor baths-usually hidden from outside view-which allow you to take in the surrounding scenery from the comfort of a hot spring. Another attractive option is arranging a kashikiri session in a private bath, whereby you and traveling companions can have a tub all to yourselves for a short time.\n### Silver everything\nUnsurprisingly for a town founded on a silver mine, Ginzan Onsen takes both its name (literally, Silver Mountain) and iconography from the element. The popular Shirogane Park boasts an impressive 22 meter tall waterfall, and you'll also find an illuminated cave which is well-lit and ideal for taking pictures.\n### Old meets new meets old\nGinzan Onsen's one notable concession to modernity is the Fujiya ryokan, a striking building designed by famed architect Kuma Kengo. With a blend of modern and traditional elements, including the incorporation of bare timber and white plaster, it stands out from its surroundings while also keeping one foot firmly in the past.\n## Keywords"}

Check Kinosaki Onsen's official website “Visit Kinosaki” for more details.\n### Don't Miss\n- Visiting the seven public bathhouses\n- Strolling in a yukata\n- Making a side trip to Onsenji Temple and the nearby mountain\n## How to Get There\nKinosaki Onsen Station is the gateway to the town, connected by the San'in Main Line to Kyoto and Osaka.\nIt takes about 2.5 hours from Kyoto or Osaka to Kinosaki Onsen Station by direct express train.\n### A riverside town\nOn either side of the Otani River are numerous Japanese inns, or ryokan, most of which have their own onsen baths.\n©Toyooka City\nThe seven public baths dotted around the town are one of the unique characteristics of Kinosaki. Visitors to the area can buy a one-day pass for 1,300 yen (as of November 2021) that allows bathing in all seven. Additionally, hot bubbling foot baths can be found in numerous locations. If you are staying at one of the town's ryokan, all of the public onsen can be accessed for free from when you check in until you check out.\n©Toyooka City\n### Slip on a yukata and stroll about town\nIt is not uncommon to see visitors to the area walking around the town in yukata—the thin cotton kimono that are closely associated with Japanese onsen towns. During the colder winter months, a warm, cotton haori jacket is worn on top of the yukata to keep out the cold.\n### The town's mysterious origins\nTowards the western end of Kinosaki Onsen is Onsenji Temple, which is dedicated to the Buddhist priest who supposedly founded Kinosaki Onsen in the 8th century. Legend has it that a priest named Douchi Shonin arrived in Kinosaki in the year 717, where he saw people suffering from incurable diseases. When he prayed for help, a white-haired man appeared to him in a dream, and suggested that he could find a hot spring. The priest believed the oracle, and chanted sutras for 1,000 days, after which hot water gushed from the ground, leading to the creation of the hot spring town.\n©Toyooka City\nOnce upon a time, visitors had to pray at the temple before they were allowed to enter the baths. While this is no longer the custom, the temple is still a great place to visit and can be combined with an enjoyable stroll through the mountains at Kinosaki's western edge.\nThe main hall of the temple can either be accessed by a short walk up the mountain or by taking the ropeway, which can take you to an observation deck at the top of the mountain.\n©Toyooka City\n### The Oriental White Stork Sanctuary\nDue to loss of habitat, the Oriental stork became extinct in Japan in 1971. The last bird actually died in Kinosaki Onsen's Toyooka City. Konotori no Sato Park was built as a research institute to protect and breed the storks, which are a National Natural Monument, and to reintroduce them to the wild. At the adjacent Stork Culture Museum, visitors can learn about efforts to reintroduce the storks, and see those used for breeding up close. The park is about 10 kilometers south of Kinosaki Onsen, and can be reached via bus from Toyooka Station.\n### Winter snow\nThe area around Kinosaki Onsen is great for activities and includes the Kannabe Kogen area. Here, visitors can enjoy climbing and hiking in summer or skiing, snowboarding and snowshoeing during winter. The town of Kinosaki receives regular snowfall and is very pretty during this season, as the river area is lined with fresh snow.\n## Keywords"}

Now the site is a stately park with castle remains dating as far back as the early 1600s.\n## How to Get There\nTake the Shinano Line from Karuizawa (24 minutes) or Nagano (60 minutes). The park is an easy three-minute walk from Komoro Station.\n### Walk where beauty and history merge\nKomoro Castle dates back to the 15th century. While most Japanese castles were built on hilltops, Komoro's was set in a depression protected by cliffs, a steep valley, and the Chikuma River.\nThe castle was abandoned and gradually dismantled after the Meiji Reformation in the late 1800s. Some important features remain, however, including parts of the original stone foundation. The historic Sannomon gate, the main entrance to the park, dates from the mid-1700s.\n### Famous cherry blossom-viewing and maple-leaf-viewing spots\nKomoro Castle Park's picturesque grounds transform into one of Nagano's more famous cherry blossom-viewing spots in the spring. Some of the trees are said to be hundreds of years old.\nThe park also holds an Autumn Leaves Festival in the fall when the leaves of its many Japanese maple trees turn a riot of hues. Kids love the small zoo and amusement park on the grounds. Several buckwheat noodle shops are located within the property and nearby.\n### The Otemon gate\nThe oldest extant part of the castle, the Otemon gate, was constructed in the early 1600s. You can find it at Otemon Park on the opposite side of the station.\nWhile in Komoro, do not miss the cliffside Nunobiki Kannon Temple, which features views over the town to Mt. Asama.\n## Keywords"}

Hakusan, Shirakawa-go is one of Gifu's must-visit destinations. Recognized by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site, this beautiful traditional village is the definition of picture-postcard perfect.\n### Don't Miss\n- Staying overnight in an authentic Japanese farmhouse\n- The traditional gassho-zukuri style houses, which were used to produce much of the silk in the Hida region\n## How to Get There\nShirakawa-go is best accessed by bus from Takayama.\nFrom Nagoya and Gifu take the JR Takayama Line to Takayama. Buses to Shirakawa-go leave from the Takayama Bus Center and take around 50 minutes.\n### Start at Ogimachi\nShirakawa-go Ogimachi is the largest hamlet of gassho-zukuri style houses in Japan. The name gassho-zukuri literally means \"like praying hands.\"\nEach house is a masterpiece of carpentry. They are built without nails—every beam slots neatly into the next. The structure is so sound that these houses have stood since the 1800s, even in this earthquake-prone nation.\n### Slip into the past\nThe existing gassho-zukuri houses serve as museums, explaining the history of the region, the special architectural style, and features, and some of the key industries of Shirakawa-go. Several of these homes are guesthouses that offer lodging.\nThe gassho-zukuri village will transport you back to pre-modern Japan. Climb up to the Shirayama observatory, look out over the village, and take in views of a time gone by.\n### Gassho-zukuri Minkaen\nThis outdoor museum was built by relocating unused gassho-zukuri houses in Shirakawa-go to recreate the traditional way of life. It features functional buildings such as storerooms and a temple, as well as the ubiquitous houses. Here, you can see demonstrations of local crafts, some of which you can have a go at. There are restaurants and souvenir shops, making it an excellent place to rest weary legs.\n### Doburoku Festival\nDoburoku is a local specialty alcohol. Doburoku is an unfiltered sake—a \"home\" brew that is illegal to produce in all but a few designated special zones.\nIn mid-October, you can partake of the drink while watching performances of the Shishi-mai lion dance.\n### Keeping house\nSome of the houses are still residences and are therefore understandably closed to the public. Others, however, are open and are definitely worth checking out.\nThe Wada House is right by the bus stop, in the center of Ogimachi, surrounded by a perfect Japanese garden.\nThe Kanda House is believed to be more than 150 years old and contains writing on the roof frame by the original carpenter from about 1850.\nThe Nagase House was home to a family of doctors and has a display of Edo period (1603-1867) medical equipment that is fascinating and troublesome in equal measure.\n### Tajima House Museum of Silk Culture\nSilk farming was one of the main industries in pre-modern Shirakawa-go, and this museum explains the history and process. The Tajima House is actually dedicated to reviving the traditional silk farming industry.\n### Myozenji Temple Museum\nThis former monk's residence next to the main temple has been turned into a museum of the temple's history since 1748. The temple itself is home to a large Buddha, and the bell tower and nearby yew tree are redolent of old Japan.\n### Glorious four seasons\nShirakawa-go rewards return visits, as the shifting seasons bring out different aspects of the town. From the bright cherry blossom through the verdant summer, the fiery autumn leaves and the silent, white winter, Shirakawa-go always looks splendid.\nYou can cover Shirakawa-go in a couple of hours, but to really soak in the atmosphere, imagine the timelessness of life in rural Japan, and lose the stress of contemporary living, you will need longer. Staying overnight in one of the lodging houses is highly recommended, but you will need to book in advance.\n## Keywords"}

When the snow melts, the area transforms into a hiking paradise.\n### Don't Miss\n- Winter sports at the mammoth Shiga Kogen Ski Area, one of Japan's largest\n- Strolling through the alpine flowers of the Higashi-Tateyama Botanical Alpine Garden\n- Trekking deep into the hills for a taste of backwoods Japan\n## How to Get There\nIn winter, the Nagano Snow Shuttle directly connects Tokyo and its airports to the Shiga Kogen Ski Area.\nFor summer exploration, renting a car is highly recommended. Otherwise, Shiga Highland is most easily accessed via the Hokuriku Shinkansen to Nagano City, the trip taking an hour and 30 minutes.\nFrom Nagano City, a 40-minute ride on the Nagano Dentetsu Line brings you to Yudanaka Station. Then it's another hour by bus to Shiga Highland.\n### Quick Facts\nShiga Highland is one of Japan's 10 UNESCO biosphere reserves\nThe Shiga Highland area is so large that to cover all of it would take around two days\n### Hit the slopes at Shiga Kogen Ski Area\nThis massive ski area came to prominence thanks to Olympic exposure. During the 1998 winter games, the area hosted a number of events including downhill skiing and snowboarding competitions. Shiga Kogen is the highest ski area in the country. Its 18 resorts, nearly 50 lifts, and over 80 kilometers of trails place it among Japan's largest snow sports hot spots. Trails weave between the resorts throughout the area, and a single lift pass covers them all.\nThe Okushiga Kogen Ski Resort is especially popular with international travelers. They offer backcountry tours in English and allow off-piste skiing, which is prohibited in many other resorts.\n### Slip on your boots and explore\nShiga Highland is home to dozens of ponds and wetland areas with over 500 varieties of alpine plants. Higashi-Tateyama Botanical Alpine Garden near the area's center is intensely beautiful in summer when the highland ecology bursts into bloom.\nWith multiple peaks over 2,000 meters high, there are dozens of hikes to choose from in the highland. These range from easy boardwalk strolls through marshland to more strenuous treks through the inner peaks. The 2,307 meter Mt. Yokote is the highest in the park, and its observation deck offers spectacular views out to the Northern Alps.\nFishing, boating, and cycling are all available in the area. Shiga Highland is lovely in the fall when the hills transform into fiery red and gold.\nFor a full experience of Shiga Highland's natural beauty, join one of Nagano Ventures week-long treks and get close to its local culture. Day hikes taking in area highlights are geared to visitors pressed for time.\nYudanaka and Shibu Onsen are both close by, as is the Snow Monkey Park at Jigokudani.\n## Keywords"}

Naeba in the Echigo Yuzawa region of Niigata Prefecture stands as a central hub for hiking, skiing, and rock music lovers. The four-square-kilometer alpine park on the top of the mountain is many people's favorite.\n## How to Get There\nReach Mt Naeba by bus, taxi or car.\nBy bus/taxi: After getting off from the Joetsu Shinkansen to Echigo-Yuzawa Station, take a bus toward Mt. Naeba Prince Hotel and get off at Mitsumata, or take a taxi direct to the trailhead.\nBy car: It takes about two hours to drive from Tokyo to Echigo Yuzawa on the Kanetsu Expressway. The closest interchange is Yuzawa IC.\n### Skiing\nThe eastern outskirts of Mt. Naeba are home to several stellar ski resorts. These include Naeba and Kagura-mitsumata. Naeba Ski Resort is one of the largest and has a variety of runs at varying levels.\n### Famous festival\nTo hype things up even more, Naeba Ski Resort holds Japan's most famous annual rock music festival—The Fuji Rock Festival —in late July/early August. When you're there, don't forget to take the Dragondola—the longest gondola in the world to Tashiro Kogen (1,346 meters) for a panoramic view of the festival site.\n### Hot springs\nNear the ski resorts are several authentic Japanese-style hot springs such as Kaikake—whose history dates back some 700 years—and Akayu, lit largely by oil lamps.\n### Hideaway\nThere is an old hideout area called the Akiyamago area on the western outskirts of Mt. Naeba. It is believed that back in the 12th century, soldiers who had lost battles against the Kamakura Shogunate resided in the Akiyamago area. The 12 villages of Akiyamago are scattered over the mountain, with lots of trees sheltering them from heavy snow.\n## Keywords"}

There is nowhere more \"off-the-beaten-path\" than Shiretoko. It's a great place to connect with the simple pleasures of nature.\n### Don't Miss\n- Shiretoko National Park for Hokkaido nature at its best\n- Drift ice cruises in the winter\n- Delicious fresh seafood straight from the ocean\n- Watching rare birds\n## How to Get There\nThere are direct flights from Tokyo (both Haneda and Narita Airport) to Memanbetsu Airport and Kushiro Airport, and flights from Haneda Airport to Monbetsu Airport. For travel within Hokkaido, there are direct flights from Sapporo (New Chitose Airport) to Memanbetsu Airport and Nemuro Nakashibetsu Airport, the two closest to Shiretoko.\nLocal public transit is scarce, so it's best to see the area by car (or rental car). However, there is an overnight bus from Sapporo that takes you to the Shiretoko area's main bus terminals and hotels.\n### Pristine natural beauty at Shiretoko National Park\nShiretoko National Park is a UNESCO World Heritage Site set in the magnificent mountains and steep cliffs of the northern tip of the Shiretoko Peninsula.\nFrom spring to autumn, you can admire the serene five lakes known collectively as Shiretoko Goko, follow hiking trails to hidden waterfalls, or take a nature cruise from Utoro for the chance to see brown bears leading their cubs along the shore, as well as some of the many species of whales, dolphins, and seals that thrive in the nutrient-rich waters. In winter, take a cruise from Rausu to observe white-tailed sea eagles and Stellar's sea eagles. Or participate in a \"drift ice walk tour,\" where you wear a dry suit and walk on drift ice. The opportunity to dive under the ice floes is a unique winter experience in Shiretoko.\n### The tip of the iceberg\nThe Shiretoko area is much larger than just the national park and offers some wonderful surprises for the adventurous. Drive 50 kilometers south along the beautiful coast road from Rausu, and you will come to the entrance to Notsuke Peninsula, a long sandbar reaching out into the Nemuro Strait.\nTake a stroll to admire the dramatic landscape of sunken forests, grazing deer, wildfowl and native flowers. The imposing Kunashiri Island sits just a few miles across the waters.\nIn winter, you can see miles of drift ice floating south on the currents toward Nemuro and Cape Nosappu. Halfway between Notsuke and Nemuro is Lake Furenko, a mecca for birdwatchers. Roughly 300 species of wild birds are regular visitors here, so take all your camera gear to get some memorable snaps of Steller's sea eagles and Japanese red-crowned cranes.\n### Relaxing waters and mountain views\nHead inland and away from the choppy waters of the Nemuro Strait to get the best views of the glorious Shiretoko mountain range stretching out into the distance. Try Kaiyoudai Observatory in Nakashibetsu or Tawadaira Observatory in Shibecha for the best views.\nEnd your day with a hot soak and delicious dinner at secluded Yoroushi Onsen.\n### Rich and delicious fish\nIt's no wonder that so many bears, whales, dolphins, and birds thrive on and around the Shiretoko Peninsula. The waters are replenished annually by rich nutrients deposited by the drift ice, meaning you get to try some of the best local seafood in Japan.\nAs a starter, try some uni (sea urchin) and hokke (Atka mackerel) in Utoro and Rausu; follow up with some ikura (salmon roe), shrimp and scallop in Odaito; and there's always room for some Hanasaki crab from Nemuro and its famous sanma (Pacific saury).\n## Keywords"}

Tsurugi\n- An epic week-long trek from Tateyama to Kamikochi—Japan's most celebrated mountain course\n## How to Get There\nMost people access the major Tateyama peaks from Murodo via the Tateyama Kurobe Alpine Route. You can embark from either side of the route, with Tateyama Station on the Toyama side or Ogizawa (Omachi City) in neighboring Nagano Prefecture.\nFrom Toyama, travel from Toyama Densetsu to Tateyama Station. From Omachi station, go to Ogizawa Station then proceed to Murodo via the Alpine Route.\n### Geography\nThe northernmost section of Japan's Hida Mountain Range (or “Northern Japan Alps”) forks into two segments with the Kurobe Dam in the valley between them.\nTo the east, The Ushiro Tateyama Mountain Range borders Nagano Prefecture and is home to the famous ski resorts of Hakuba. To the west, the Tateyama Mountain Range is entirely in Toyama and more central to the prefecture's identity.\nBy far the most visually distinctive of the peaks, Tsurugi sits regally in the center like a rugged jewel in a crown. Just south of Tsurugi, the gentler contours of Tateyama belie the fact that it's actually the taller of the two. As major peaks in the Hida Mountains, Tateyama and Tsurugi also rank among the highlights of the Chubu Sangaku National Park.\n### Toyama's holy mountain\nThough usually spoken of as a single mountain, Tateyama actually has three peaks, with the best-known (Oyama) being only the second highest. Together with mountains Fuji and Hakusan, Tateyama claims the title of one of the country's Three Holy Mountains.\nLegend has it that an eighth-century hunter pursued a wounded bear all the way to Murodo only to see it transform into a golden Buddha. Thereafter, the hunter became a priest, tasked with tending to this new sacred place. Nowadays, the mountaintop shrine of Oyama is one of the mountain's main attractions.\nThe convenient location and relatively easy ascent makes Tateyama very popular during the warmer months. You may find that crowds are a greater obstacle to reaching the top than any difficulty in the course. So consider bunking down at a mountain lodge or hotel to break up your journey and ease tired muscles. Theoretically, you can do it as a day trip, but timing might be tight.\n### The big one\nTsurugi was the last major peak in Japan to be summited. It took until the year 1906 for officials from Japan's Land Survey Department to reach the top with many failed attempts which added to the mountain's aura of danger.\nThey had believed themselves en route to the first successful ascent, but on reaching the summit discovered a sword and staff dating from before the 12th century. The mystery of how these items got there remains unsolved.\nTateyama is a significantly easier mountain to climb than Mt. Tsurugi. It avoids the tag of 'technical climbing,' but only by having a well-maintained network of chains and ladders reducing the need for ropes and other climbing gear. Even with a sturdy chain to grasp, you'll still find yourself negotiating exposed ridges with sheer drops below.\nMost attempts to climb Tsurugi begin at Murodo where you can set off on foot for the Kenzanso Mountain Lodge. This facility, which operates from July to mid-October, is the ideal stop off point for a 10 to 12 hour hike. If you get an early start (say 4:30 a.m.), you can make it back to Murodo that afternoon to catch the last bus back to civilization.\n### Tateyama to Kamikochi\nThe six to seven day hike from Tateyama to Kamikochi (or the reverse) is one of Japan's premier treks.\nAfter alighting from Murodo, head east to Mt. Tateyama and beyond. From there, the basic breakdown of the hike is as follows:\nDay One: Murodo to Goshikigahara, six to seven hours, and you can climb Mt. Tateyama along the way if the weather cooperates.\nDay Two: Goshikigahara to Yakushidake Sanso, eight to 10 hours via another famous mountain, Yakushidake.\nDay Three: Yakushidake Sanso to Kurobegoro Goya, six to eight hours, includes yet another famous mountain, Kurobegorodake.\nDay Four: Kurobegoro Goya to Mt. Yarigatake, eight to 10 hours, ending at another iconic Japanese peak.\nDays Five and Six: Mt. Yarigatake to the Hotakadake Sanso to Kamikochi, 11 to 15 hours, the single most vaunted multi-peak excursion in Japan. Beginners beware! Things do get genuinely dangerous on the Daikiretto Traverse.\n### When to go\nAll of these hikes share the same July to early October window. Experienced, well-equipped hikers may opt to climb Tateyama as early as late April, after the Alpine Route has opened. Crampons are required gear, ice axes are recommended, and don't skimp on the cold weather wear. Casual hikers should plan a hike for July to mid-October.\nTsurugi follows the same rules as Tateyama with the caveat that early-spring hiking is much more dangerous on the more difficult mountain.\nFor the Tateyama to Kamikochi hike, mid-July to early October is best. Earlier in the season, residual snow presents problems for the lightly-equipped and some huts will not be open, discouraging amateur hikers.\n## Keywords"}

Hakusan is the 1300-year-old hot spring resort town of Kaga Onsen in southwestern Ishikawa. This town is built around four onsen villages. Kaga Onsen offers high-quality natural onsen waters, traditional Japanese craft, authentic nature walks, and sumptuous local, regional specialties. This is the ultimate place to relax. Just come and hop in the baths.\n### Don't Miss\n- Hot spring-hopping in the four nearby towns' public baths\n- Trying your hand at traditional crafts, like Kutani pottery and Yamanaka lacquerware\n- Sampling a variety of local food sourced from the sea and the rich, fertile mountains\n## How to Get There\nRide into Kaga Onsen Station, the hub of the area. A 25 to 30-minute train ride or an hour's drive southwest of Kanazawa.\nRide the Hokuriku Shinkansen to Kanazawa Station (2 hours, 30 minutes) and then change to a limited express train (25 minutes). From Tokyo, ride the Hokuriku Shinkansen to Kanazawa Station (2 hours, 30 minutes), changing to a limited express train (25 minutes). The limited express Thunderbird and limited express Shirasagi connect Kanazawa and Kaga Onsen in 25-30 minutes.\nFrom Kyoto, the limited express Thunderbird also connects Kaga Onsen in about 2 hours and 15 minutes.\nFrom Nagoya, take the shinkansen to Maibara and change to the limited express Shirasagi bound for Kanazawa, which takes about two hours.\nThe Can Bus from Kaga Onsen Station takes visitors to major sites. Choose the mountain route or the sea route, or the Komatsu Airport Line.\n### Healing waters\nKaga Onsen Kyo is made up of four hot-spring villages: Yamashiro Onsen, Yamanaka Onsen, Awazu Onsen and Katayamazu Onsen. Each onsen town has its own public bath at the town center. Some of them have been completely modernized, while others are reminiscent of the Meiji era (1868-1912) in their special decorative styles.\nThe hot springs of Kaga Onsen were discovered by the Buddhist monk, Gyoki, on a pilgrimage in the eighth century. They have since been praised as some of the best in Japan, with healing properties that improve digestion, relieve muscle pain, and alleviate skin diseases.\n### The birthplace of kutani ceramics\nKutaniyaki, a distinct type of Japanese porcelain, flourished in Ishikawa during the Edo period (1603-1867), when wealthy samurai and merchants from the Daishoji and Kaga families supported the development of the regional arts. You can recognize this style from its distinct patterns and use of vivid colors — particularly bright reds, greens, yellows, purples and blues. It was exported to Europe in large quantities after 1873. At the Ishikawa Prefecture Kutaniyaki Art Museum south of the city and the Kutaniyaki Exhibition Hall in Yamashiro Onsen, you can see collections of the pottery and ruins of a multi-level kiln.\n### Living legends and up-and-coming artisans\nMany artists are based in Kaga Onsen today and have perfected their craft over several decades. Woodturning and lacquerware are very closely related, and the woodturner Ryozo Kawakita residing in Yamanaka Onsen was designated a Living National Treasure in 1994. These artistic traditions are being carried on by younger artists living in the Kaga region, particularly ceramicists, who are reshaping tradition with more contemporary pieces. You may be able to see their work at art fairs and exhibitions in Kaga Onsen as well as Kanazawa.\n### Make the most of your stay\nStaying one or two nights at one of the traditional ryokan is the best way to explore Kaga Onsen's hot spring villages. Give yourself one or two days to see the temples, experience craft art and visit the many foot baths and public baths scattered throughout the adjacent towns.\n### The ultimate ryokan experience\nVoted as having some of the best ryokan in Japan, Kaga Onsen is home to several luxury Japanese inns. These include the highly praised Kayotei, known for its unparalleled service, and the Relais & Chateaux property Beniya Mukayu, with a private open-air bath in each room.\n### A climb or drive around Kaga Onsen\nIf you're active and adventurous and would like to see panoramic views of the Japan Alps and the Sea of Japan, the summit of Mt. Hakusan can be climbed in a day with an early start, or as an overnight trip staying at one of the mountain huts.\nDuring the summer months through to mid-November, the Hakusan White Road is a more relaxing and charming way to continue your journey from Kaga Onsen through the mountains to historical Shirakawa-go in Gifu Prefecture. You will certainly arrive relaxed and limber after all the onsen-bathing.\n## Keywords"}

The same train stops at Iiyama Station as well.\nFrom Tokyo's airports, the Nagano Snow Shuttle connects directly to Hakuba, Nozawa Onsen, and Shiga Kogen; it also runs between the three resorts. (Buses have been temporarily suspended due to the pandemic)\nHakuba and Shiga Kogen are most easily reached via Nagano City, and Nozawa Onsen via Iiyama. Direct buses to the resorts are also available from Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya.\n### The slopes of Nagano\nNagano is home to 80 ski resorts, from the sprawling Shiga Kogen to the compact and family-friendly Fujimi Panorama Resort. Depending on local conditions, slopes start opening in late November and run until mid-April or even later at the higher elevations. Regardless of the resort, January and February is peak season; the year-end holidays are particularly busy, as is the Chinese New Year.\n### The powder snow skier's paradise of Hakuba Valley\nThis world-class resort area in Nagano's Northern Alps welcomes powder enthusiasts from around the globe. The 1998 Winter Olympics put Hakuba on the map when it hosted ski jump, downhill and slalom events.\nIt boasts 10 resorts, 92 lifts, and 137 runs that stretch over 30 kilometers along the Hakuba Valley. With over 11 meters of annual snowfall, some of the nation's best powder and superb views, Hakuba is one of Japan's most popular winter sports areas.\nTen of Hakuba Valley's resorts have teamed up to offer a Hakuba Valley lift ticket available for single or multiple day use. The expansive Happo-one is closest to the village. Along with adjacent Echoland, it has the best nightlife in the area. The sister resorts of Able Hakuba Goryu Snow Resort and Hakuba47 Winter Sports Park have runs open as late as May. Hakuba Cortina Ski Resort in Otari Village is legendary for deep powder and off-piste tree riding.\n### Shiga Kogen Ski Resort\nThis huge ski area in the mountain town of Yamanouchi is the second highest ski area in the country. Its 19 resorts, nearly 70 lifts, and over 80 kilometers of trails place it among Japan's largest. Trails weave between the resorts throughout the area, and a single lift pass covers them all.\nThe Okushiga Kogen Ski Resort is one of Shiga Kogen's most popular. Its facilities are geared toward international travelers. It offers back-country tours and allows off-piste skiing, which is prohibited in much of the resort.\nShiga Kogen is close to Shibu Onsen, Yudanaka Onsen, and the famed Snow Monkey Park, where Japanese macaques come down from the snowy hills to warm up in the baths.\n### Warm up at Nozawa Onsen\nThis tiny hot spring enclave has become an internationally famous ski resort that's just as popular for its village atmosphere as for its slopes. It can get up to ten meters of snow each season, making it a Nagano favorite for powder enthusiasts. Nineteen lifts, new gondolas and 50 kilometers of courses provide a winter paradise for skiers and snowboarders of all levels.\nNothing beats a hot spring soak after a long day on the slopes and for this, Nozawa is the best. Free public onsen are run by the neighborhood associations throughout the village.\nAt night, the village center bustles with visitors heading to dinner or milling about shopping and soaking up the mixed traditional Japanese and European ski village atmosphere.\nIf you're here in mid-January, don't miss the Nozawa Fire Festival, one of the wildest traditional Shinto displays in the land.\n### Beyond the big resorts\nAlong with the three famous areas, many smaller resorts operate throughout the prefecture. While they have fewer facilities, they also tend to be less crowded. Some of these are listed below. See the corresponding area pages for details and access.\nFujimi Panorama Resort occupies a stretch of the Yatsugatake Mountains. Combine skiing here with a stay at Kamisuwa Onsen while exploring the Suwa area.\nMt. Norikura Snow Resort is in the southernmost reaches of the Northern Alps. This is the best resort if you're staying at nearby Shirahone Onsen.\nTogakushi Ski Resort is about an hour northwest of Nagano City. It's perfect for combining with a visit to Togakushi's ancient shrine and slurping up a bowl of its famed buckwheat soba noodles.\nKaruizawa Prince Snow Resort is just minutes from Karuizawa Station. After you come down from the slopes, head to Kyu-Karuizawa for some great restaurants and a handful of bars.\nMt. Ontake in southwestern Nagano has several ski resorts in Kaida Kogen, Kiso, and Otaki Village. These resorts are great for a break from exploring the Kiso Valley's old Nakasendo post towns.\n## Keywords"}

Practitioners of this shadow art called Togakushi, and its once inaccessible mountains, home. The mountains had long been inhabited by Buddhist-shaman ascetics known as yamabushi, and aspects of their philosophy found their way into the Togakushi school.\n### Get up close with weapons only seen on the big screen\nSpread over several reloated and resotred buildings, the Togakushi Ninja Museum lets you delve into ninja history with a variety of exhibits and activities. Their displays of traditional weaponry include katana (Japanese swords). Blade-like metal throwing stars known as shuriken are laid out in more shapes and sizes than you'd think possible.\n### Learn all about the hidden history of the ninja\nWhile the weaponry certainly catches the eye, much of the ninja's craft involved espionage, infiltration, and generally going unseen. Escape was key, and contrary to ninja movies, violence was typically avoided.\nInformation boards illustrating these arts are on display, as is ninja clothing and gear that remind visitors the ninjas were human, too. The museum walls are covered with photographs of ninja demonstrating their craft.\n### Visit the ninja house\nA “ninja house” in an adjacent building is a museum highlight. The house is full of traps and secret passageways; once inside, it's a veritable labyrinth that's notoriously tough to get out of. Once you finally escape, sneak over to the target range and try out your shuriken throwing skills.\nThe Museum of Togakushi Folklore on the property houses a wide collection of antiques and artifacts used by the locals in days gone by.\n### Ninja fun for the little ones\nKids will enjoy the Kids Ninja Village 3.4 kilometers down the road from The Togakushi Ninja Museum. This ninja theme park lets kids don ninja outfits and slink their way through attractions like forested adventure playgrounds, climbing walls, and a blow dart range. They offer game-style, shuriken-throwing courses.\n## Keywords"}

The men of the village, especially those aged 25 and 42, which are considered unlucky years in Japan, play an important role. The flames of the torches they hold light up the night, and a fierce battle ensues.\nLarge numbers of villagers carry torches and attempt to burn down a temporary shrine called a shaden, while the 25 year-olds defend the structure and the 42 year-olds sing and chant. This festival is meant to celebrate the birth of a family's first child, and pray for their good health, and to pray for a good harvest.\n### Don't Miss\n- Grilled dough pockets with savory fillings called oyaki\n## How to Get There\nThe Nagano Snow Shuttle offers a direct connection between Tokyo's airports, Shinjuku Station, and Nozawa (about six hours). It also runs between Nozawa and the Nagano resorts of Hakuba and Shiga Kogen.\nAlternatively, take the Hokuriku Shinkansen from Tokyo Station to Iiyama (1 hour 40 minutes) and then the Nozawa Onsen Liner bus (25 minutes). Direct buses are available through the winter from Osaka, Kyoto and Nagoya.\nThe festival takes place in a square called Dosojinba, about a five-minute walk from the Oyu public bathhouse on the main street.\n### Bring on the fire\nIn Japan, the ages of 25 and 42 are considered astrologically unlucky for men. The Nozawa Dosojin Festival combines a rite of passage to protect them with ancient New Year rituals.\nIn Japanese, the festival is known as Dosojin Matsuri, in honor of the tutelary Dosojin deities it honors. The Dosojin are believed to fend off epidemics and various other misfortunes. They're commonly found carved into stones on roadsides and borders throughout central Japan; in Nozawa Onsen, they appear as two wooden poles painted as a human couple.\nThe earliest record of the festival in its current form dates to the mid-1800s, but the roots go much further back.\nThe day before the festivities, around a hundred villagers build a makeshift shrine at the Dosojinba. As the festival begins, the 42-year-olds sit atop the shrine, singing to the Dosojin; the 25-year-olds stand at the bottom, holding ropes attached to the shrine. As the time to start draws near, they chant “Bring on the fire! Bring on the fire!”\nIn response to their calls, columns of villagers bearing bundled reed torches attack the shrine, doing their best to set it alight. The men holding the ropes have to protect the shrine, whatever comes. One after another the villagers charge, and a battle of sparks and flame ensues.\nAfter the siege, the shrine building is set alight at around 10:00p.m. As the shrine building burns down, the festival comes to an end. The fire burns until the next day, and many people roast and eat rice cakes and other food the next morning, over the remains of the fire. It is said that if you roast and eat rice cakes on this fire, you will live in good health for a whole year without catching a cold.\n## Keywords"}

The journey should take a little over four hours.\n### Quick Facts\nDuring the Dattan procession, a seven-meter pine torch is waved through the air while locals shout \"aye!\"\nYou can buy a torch and attach a prayer of your choice to it\n### When in Obama\nThe festival begins at 11 a.m., but it isn't open to the public until 1 p.m. You can purchase a torch for 1,500–2,000 yen and participate in the evening procession with other members of the public, which begins at 6 p.m.\nThe torch-bearing procession walks around two kilometers from Jinguji to the Onyu River. It is an incredible scene.\nOnce the procession arrives, the head priest of Jinguji uses a sword to ward off evil spirits and reads an incantation before pouring the sacred water into the river. The water reaches Todaiji Nigatsudo 10 days later.\n## Keywords"}

The excitement runs high as large, painstakingly decorated lantern floats are paraded through towns, followed by lighting portable shrines on fire, or throwing them into the sea. The fire is believed to burn away people's troubles and misfortunes.\n### Don't Miss\n- The beautiful, intricately designed floats\n- Lively parades of lanterns and portable shrines\n- The fiery climax\n## How to Get There\nThe festivals are held all over the Noto Peninsula in different towns and cities. Kanazawa is the main transport hub in Ishikawa, with trains and buses serving the peninsula. Light traffic and scenic coastal roads make the peninsula an ideal driving destination.\nTo access the peninsula by rail, take the JR Nanao Line from Kanazawa Station. The journey to Wakura Onsen takes an hour by express train. Local lines continue from Wakura Onsen as far north as Anamizu.\nFor Wajima, on the northern tip of the peninsula, take the Hokutetsu express bus from Kanazawa. Expect the journey to take a little over two hours.\nFrom Tokyo's Haneda Airport, there are direct flights to Noto Airport, in the center of the peninsula. From there you can rent a car or catch a bus to Wajima or Anamizu.\n### Quick Facts\nThe first Noto Kiriko festivals were held in the late 17th century\nKiriko means “sacred lantern”\n### Ishikawa's greatest summer festivals\nThere are multiple Kiriko festivals held during this season, and you can see one virtually every weekend. No festival is quite the same, with each community having its own customs and traditions.\n### Intricately decorated floats\nKiriko toro, or simply kiriko as they are commonly called, are the large illuminated lantern floats carried during the Noto Kiriko summer festivals. The smaller floats are carried by children, and larger ones—reaching up to up to 15 meters tall—are carried by young adults.\nThe floats are often decorated with gold leaf and carvings on the upper part of the roof, and the lanterns are painted with Japanese characters and illustrations. In more recent times, the lanterns have also been decorated with pictures of anime characters. Each area of Noto is proud of its own floats, and towns try to outdo each other with their energy levels and designs.\n### Origins of the festival\nIn the late 1600s, people began the Noto Kiriko tradition to ward off epidemics and other illnesses and to pray for good harvests.\nEach community builds its own floats, with the sacred lanterns the focal point, and proudly parades them in their towns' central areas from dusk. Many of them have large torches attached. The processions are lively and dynamic, with festival-goers chanting, dancing and making merry far into the night.\n### Kicking off the festivities\nOne of the most enthralling of the Noto Kiriko festivals is the Abare festival in the town of Ushitsu, which kicks off the festival season on the first Friday and Saturday of July. Abare literally means “fire and violence.” Both mikoshi—portable shrines—and kiriko are paraded around the town, and carried around large bonfires. Children sit on the upper decks of the large wooden kiriko and play drums and flutes.\n### Rampaging portable shrines\nThe second night of the festival is the highlight when teams of half-naked men appear with mikoshi shrines and proceed to thrash them against the ground, drag them through rivers and toss them into fires. The festival reaches a feverish finale as the floats are set ablaze, and sparks fly. The festivities draw to a close in the early morning hours.\n### Differing traditions\nIn other areas of Noto, traditions vary—some festivals feature wild dancing, others climax with the floats being carried into the sea as fireworks light the sky. In some towns, teams of women carry the floats.\n### If you can't make it to the festival\nEven if you are not able to attend one of the festivals while traveling in Noto, you can visit the Wajima Kiriko Hall in Wajima City, close to the Wajima Morning Fish Market, and get an up-close look at floats spared from a fiery death or watery end.\n## Keywords"}

The entire journey takes about 15 minutes.\nThere is also a long bridge at the end of the trail, where you can view the waterfall in its entirety.\nIn summer, it is popular among visitors to wade or swim in the water near the falls, but enter at your own risk as the currents can get pretty rapid.\n### Try the local noodles\nAt a restaurant near the parking lot at the beginning of the hike, you can try a fun and memorable dish called nagashi-somen. This is a dish of noodles served by floating them down a bamboo slide. You will have to catch the noodles with chopsticks.\nThere are also cafes, vending machines, bathrooms, and benches at the entrance of the waterfall.\n## Keywords"}

The pair visited Iyo-no-Kuni, which is now known as Ehime Prefecture. While visiting the area, Sukunabikona fainted from illness. To cure him, Okuninushi piped water from Beppu Onsen to the ancient Dogo Onsen, which miraculously cured Sukunabikona.\n### The bath of samurai\nLater, in the Kamakura Period (1185-1333), wounded samurai bathed in Beppu Onsen to help speed recovery. Today, locals and tourists alike journey to the area to soak, for relaxation of the body and mind.\n### The perfect water for all types\nHot spring water varieties range from those high in chloride to those high in sodium bicarbonate. Many of the baths are claimed to be beneficial for illnesses like neuralgia, rheumatism, and fatigue. You can also try drinking the spring water at some hot springs (please check with staff beforehand), which is said to help gastroenteritis, diabetes, and gout.\n### Record-breaking onsen hub\nThere are close to 3,000 hot spring sources in Beppu City, representing more than 10% of all vents in Japan.

The sweeping grasslands of the area are scattered with white limestone mounds and conical sinkholes. The Karst extends along rolling mountains and has multiple trails with expansive panoramas of the Shikoku region and the Pacific Ocean.\n### Don't Miss\n- The mossy trails and ancient trees of Keyakidaira\n- Other-worldly stargazing opportunities\n- Scenic hikes and stunning seasonal blooms\n## How to Get There\nHard to reach by public transport and therefore suited to intrepid travelers, this pristine natural hideout can be accessed by car from Kochi and Matsuyama or a combination of taxi, bus and train travel from Kochi Station.\nIf you choose to rent a car, the scenic drive from either Kochi or Matsuyama takes around two hours. The journey by public transport and taxi requires a number of changes.\nTo get there via public transport, depart from Kochi Station and arrive at Susaki Station to catch a bus towards Yusuhara. Change again at Shinden and take a taxi to Hoshifuru Village Tengu (formerly Tenguso), in the middle of the Karst. During the winter months, some areas of the Karst become inaccessible due to snow.\n### Quick Facts\nThe area is split into three parts; the Tengu Highland, Keyakidaira and Mezurudaira\nThe karst has an elevation of 1,400 meters\nThe area straddles both Ehime and Kochi prefectures\n### A place for all seasons\nThe Shikoku Karst transitions seamlessly with the seasons. Spring sees the grasses turn a vibrant hue of green. On hikes through the area in summer, you can see lilies all around. Old man of the mountain and forget-me-nots also dot the hillsides.\nRich, vibrant leaves cover the trees during fall months, whilst the grass turns a striking shade of silver. Then in the winter, you may find a dusting of the purest white snow covering the hillsides.\n### Forest bathing\nThe hiking trail in the Tengu Highlands that passes through Tengu Forest is a great way to soak up the area's incredible beauty. Look out for the Japanese cypress wood-chip paths meandering through the forest, which are surrounded by stunning white birch and red pine trees.\nThe walk takes approximately three hours and at the end of it, you are rewarded with fantastic views of the Shikoku mountains and on a clear day, the Pacific Ocean.\n### The great outdoors\nDuring summer months, camping is the perfect way to immerse yourself in the tranquil atmosphere of the Karst. The Mezurudaira area has plenty of campsites where you'll find pastoral scenes of cows lazily grazing. The Karst is so far from any major cities there is little to no light pollution, making it the perfect spot to stargaze.\n### A riot of color\nThe nearby Ogawamine area includes several notable mountains. Kasatori, Ogawamine, Mikawamine, and Ubahodo all reach heights of between 900 and 1,500 meters. In spring, the mountains are carpeted with the bold magenta rhododendron flowers. On a clear day, you can see Mt. Ishizuchi and the Sata Peninsula nearby.\n### Warm hospitality\nIn the midst of the Karst's Highlands sits the Hoshifuru Village Tengu (formerly Tenguso) and Mezuruso Cottages. Taste the flavors of the mountains, such as pheasant and wild boar served alongside the best of seasonal produce.\nHoshifuru Village Tengu has a large bath which looks over the Pacific and the Ishizuchi mountains, and is the perfect place to unwind after a long day of hiking. At Mezuruso, try amago, a red spotted masu trout from the nearby rivers of Kumakogen, cooked on an outdoor charcoal fire. Both accommodations also have campsites.\n### Starlight, waterfalls and fairytale villages\nMuch like Shirakawa-go, the thatched farmhouse village of Kumakogen Furusato Ryoko Mura could have been lifted from a fairytale. The planetarium and observatory offer unimpeded views of the twinkling night skies. Nearby, Omogo Gorge and Goraiko and Gongen waterfalls draw visitors with their clear rippling waters and dense surrounding forest.\n## Keywords"}

Winding through the mountains of Honshu's Kii Peninsula, an area straddling Wakayama, Nara, Osaka and Mie prefectures, it's been walked by pilgrims on their quest for enlightenment for over a millennium.\nModern travelers come to experience moments of quiet contemplation, commune with nature, and go deep into Japan's spiritual history.\n### Don't Miss\n- Treading the same paths as past pilgrims, including ascetics, samurai, emperors, and monks\n- Kumano Nachi-taisha Shrine and its temple, a perfect example of Shinto-Buddhist fusion\n- Taking advantage of the luggage shuttle services along the route so you can trek baggage free\n## How to Get There\nThe pilgrimage trails crisscross the Kii Peninsula, and access depends on your ultimate destination and how far you wish to hike. The main means of transportation to the area are Osaka, Kyoto, and Nagoya using the Kisei Mainline (also known as the Kinokuni line).\nTo access Kumano Nachi Taisha Shrine and Nachi Seigantoji Temple, take a 30-minute bus from Kii-Katsuura Station (on the JR Kinokuni Line) to the parking lot in front of the shrine and temple.\nAccess Kumano Hayatama Taisha via a 15-minute walk from JR Shingu Station, also on the JR Kinokuni Line.\nKumano Hongu Taisha is approximately an hour and 15 minutes from Kii-Tanabe Station (on the JR Kinokuni Line) via Ryujin Bus on the Kumano Hongu Line. Get off at Kumano Hongu Taisha-mae.\n### Quick Facts\nThe entire pilgrimage route is made up of seven trails\nIn 2004 the traditional trails along with their holy mountains were designated a UNESCO World Heritage site\nA mythical three-legged crow is the symbol of the Kumano Kodo, and of Japan's national soccer team\n### Kumano, the dwelling place of the gods\nSince its earliest days, the Kumano region has been regarded as a spiritually powerful area where gods inhabit the very fabric of the natural landscape.\nDuring the Heian Period (794-1185), former emperors began making the arduous trek to the region in search of spiritual enlightenment. The pilgrimage gradually became more widely known from that time.\n### The spiritual triumvirate of Kumano Sanzan\nKumano Sanzan is the collective name for the area's three most sacred shrines: Kumano Hayatama Taisha Shrine, Kumano Nachi Taisha Shrine (including adjoining Nachi Seigantoji Temple) and Kumano Hongu Taisha Shrine.\nTogether they are the sacred center of the Kumano region. Uniquely designed and originally offering separate forms of nature worship, the three eventually merged, becoming a major pilgrimage destination.\n### 99 Oji Shrines as spiritual signposts\nWhile the Kumano Sanzan shrines remain the big draw of the pilgrimage, many smaller shrines are scattered along the route. Known as the 99 Oji Shrines, their purpose is to provide protection and guidance for the wandering pilgrims.\n### Religious harmony through Shinbutsu-shugo\nBefore political policy forced them apart in the late 19th century, Buddhism and Shinto coexisted quite peacefully as Shinbutsu-shugo, a fusion of the two belief systems. Shinto gods were considered to be indigenous manifestations of Buddhist deities. This was the norm in Japan for over a thousand years.\nIn the 19th century, Buddhism was separated from Shinto and many temples and Buddhist statues were destroyed.\nWhile it's relatively rare to find Buddhist and Shinto elements intertwined today, Kumano Nachi Taisha Shrine and the adjoining Nachi Seigantoji Temple illustrate the traditional relationship very well.\n## Keywords"}
